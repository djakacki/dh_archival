Mary Miles Minter Here and There

Some previous issues of TAYLOROLOGY have reprinted interviews given by Mary Miles Minter throughout her life. Below are some short press items published during her acting career which provide fragments of additional information.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

December 7, 1908 CINCINNATI TIMES-STAR Mr. Nat Goodwin used up all of the fifty-seven varieties of poses in responding to curtain calls at the Lyric Sunday night, which curtain calls were not given out of admiration for, nor even interest in "Cameo Kirby." They were grounded upon a desire to welcome back an actor who was once an artist...As a play it is so full of inharmonious situations, so replete with impossibilities, so crowded with cheap conveniences, and generally so trivial and inconsequential, that it is a wonder that one sees Booth Tarkington's name attached to the play...Not one of the ten of twelve characters is equipped with lines or duties which seem to flow harmoniously or consistently out of real life, saving, perhaps, little Juliet Shelby, who plays the part of a small child. As children may be expected to do almost anything unexpected or strange, her errors are easily overlooked...

September 7, 1912 NEW YORK CLIPPER Chicago--Lou M. Houseman, western representative for A. H. Woods, and Fred F. Fleck, manager of "The Littlest Rebel," were arraigned in Judge Scott's court Thursday, Aug. 29, on a charge of using Mary Miles Minter in the play in violation of the State labor laws regulating the employment of children. The case was continued by agreement to Sept. 3. The State factory department claims it has a statement from the girl's grandmother that she was born in 1902. The defense says the girl is seventeen years old. She plays the part of the Littlest Rebel. Many of the members of the cast will be summoned as witnesses at the next hearing of the case.

December 1915 PHOTOPLAY While enacting a scene for the production of "Barbara Frietchie" recently, at Fort Lee, Mary Miles Minter accidentally shot William Morse in the arm. The wound did not prove very serious, although it caused a lot of excitement for a while.

December 12, 1915 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH The Columbia-Metro aggregation of players, under Edgar Jones and with Mary Miles Minter as the star, whose destination is St. Augustine, left New York on a special Pullman car on Wednesday, December 8. They will at once begin work on two five-part features, "Dimples" and "A Scrap of Pasteboard," both of them original manuscripts.

February 11, 1916 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Mary Miles Minter, the popular Metro star, who will shortly be seen in the stellar role of "Dimples," took a day off recently to buy articles and prepare a crate in which to send a number of things to the soldiers now at the front in Europe. Miss Minter's private tutor, Miss Coursolies McCaul, received word that her brother had enlisted with a Canadian regiment and would leave for England within a few days. Miss McCaul arranged to go to Toronto to see her brother off. Miss Minter readily granted her a week's vacation. Then Miss Minter remarked that it would not seem right to send the young man without some sort of remembrance, although she had never seen him. Accompanied by her mother, she went on a shopping expedition and bought everything that a little girl thinks a soldier needs. Among these things was a set of poker chips and cards in a compact case.

February 25, 1916 VARIETY Film Ball Aftermaths.

...When Mary Miles Minter, elected queen of the ball, trecked round the hall under the spot leaning on the arm of "Governor Whitman," as announced by Joe Humphreys, Jim McKenna, the Governor's Bayside, L. I., double commandeered by the Minter legions when it was discovered that the real Governor wasn't coming all the Baysiders present haw-hawed...

February 26, 1916 NEW YORK CLIPPER Heavy Evening for Mary

In future, when Mary Miles Minter goes touring on the East Side, New York, she will carry an interpreter with her. Thursday night Mary appeared in Loew's Avenue B Theatre and dwelt at great length upon the subject of motion pictures. Leaving the theatre she entered her flivver, which she manages herself, and endeavored to ride through the crowd. Suddenly an inhabitant of the neighborhood dashed in front of the machine gesticulating wildly and mumbled incoherently. Immediately Mary became frightened, and shrieked for the police and mama. The crowd took up the cry and soon pandemonium reigned with no one aware what it was all about. A gendarme approached and grasped the culprit firmly by the collar and was about to drag him off to the bastille when the prisoner, pointing to the lamps on the auto, said excitedly: "I vant to tell her der lights iss oudt!" This caused the cop to walk out of the picture in disgust.

March 19, 1916 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Mary Miles Minter, the young star of the screen, who is now appearing in Metro plays, has returned from a tour of several of the largest cities in Canada, where she was tendered a truly marvelous reception. She was received by royalty, dined and feted by college students, visited hospitals, edited the motion picture page of a big newspaper for one day, gave away thousands of autographed photographs, and received so many flowers from boy and girl admirers that it was necessary to obtain an automobile to convey them to her hotel. In Montreal Miss Minter appeared at various theatres and was welcomed by more than 25,000 persons. She first visited the Children's Memorial Hospital and presented each of the children with a pound box of candy. Later in the parlors of the Windsor Hotel she held a reception for the boys and girls of thirteen years old, her own age. In the evening she appeared at the Imperial Theatre, where she was presented with a handsome traveling bag by her boy and girl admirers. When she went to supper at the Windsor later in the night she found the dining room had been converted into a veritable flower garden. The following day she appeared at several theatres, and in every one scores of bouquets were thrown at her feet on the stage. In the evening there was a reception for Miss Minter in the private theatre of the Starfilms, Ltd., the distributors of Metro pictures in Canadian territory. Among those who attended the reception were Sir Rudolphe and Lady Forget and family, Mr. and Mrs. Martin, Madame Z. Herbert, Mr. and Mrs. Donor, Arthur Ecrement, Paul Gailbert, Dr. and Mrs. Fleury, A. N. Brodeur, Mrs. H. Lubin and Mr. M. R. Lubin. Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, the mother of Miss Minter, presented her to the distinguished members of the party. In Ottawa Miss Minter took complete editorial charge of the motion picture page of the Ottawa Journal and was given a large basket of flowers by William McLoughlin, the editor. She appeared at the Regent Theatre in the evening. That night Miss Minter personally gave away 2,000 photographs of herself. Later in the evening she appeared at the Chateau Laurier, where she made a little speech to 600 boys and girls. She was the guest of honor at the Athletic Club of Ottawa at Rockcliffe Park, where she participated in the ice skating, ski jumping and snowshoe sports.

May 13, 1916 REEL LIFE Wednesday, May 10, "Mutual Day" at the Motion Picture Board of Trade of America Exposition at Madison Square Garden, was the crowning event of a week of singular achievements. Thousands who thronged the Garden gathered in and about the Mutual booth during the afternoon and evening, eager to catch a glimpse, receive a handshake or extend their congratulation to the galaxy of Mutual stars who were in attendance. Mary Miles Minter, the newest of the Mutual stars, was the center of attraction. Hundreds of picture devotees, but few of whom had ever seen this charming little star in person, crowded about her, showering her with congratulations and carrying away with them autographed photographs, thousands of which were distributed by her and other Mutual stars during the course of the day...

May 14, 1916 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Mary Miles Minter, the dainty Mutual star, will leave New York today on the Twentieth Century for Chicago, where a big celebration is planned for the youngest star in filmdom. Miss Minter will be accompanied by her mother, Mrs. Juliet [sic] Shelby. On her arrival in Chicago Miss Minter will be met by J. Casey Cairnes and officials of the American Film Company, Inc., who will escort her to the new American film laboratories. After a tour of inspection a reception will be held in her honor. In the evening she will be the guest of honor at a dinner being arranged for her. She is anxious to get to the Coast to begin work in the first of the special features she is to appear in. Miss Minter and her mother will leave for the American studios at Santa Barbara Monday night.

June 24, 1916 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Led by the Mayor and various of his official family, Santa Barbara, Cal., residents gave a rousing reception to little Mary Miles Minter, the American-Mutual child star, on her recent arrival at the southern California city to begin work on her first Mutual feature release. Long before the arrival of the train at the station numerous of the city's stanch residents were on hand. Accompanied by her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, Miss Minter appeared on the rear platform, and after a brief address of welcome delivered by the Mayor she was escorted through the crowd and rushed to the American-Mutual studios, where the celebration continued. As a token of comradeship members of the American-Mutual playing forces insisted that Miss Minter be delegated to open the new concrete dressing quarters at the plant. In the parade from the depot to the studio exactly 162 autos took part.

February 1917 PHOTOPLAY Mary Miles Minter had a narrow escape from death in an automobile accident early in December while en route in her automobile from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara. She sustained injuries which are keeping her on the hospital list but she got off much more lucky than her mother and sister, Margaret Shelby. Mrs. Gertrude [sic] Shelby, the mother of the girls was driving when the car skidded and turned over in the ditch. Mrs. Shelby sustained a broken arm, her sister was badly cut and bruised and Miss Minter suffered severe cuts from broken glass.

March 24, 1917 MOVING PICTURE WORLD The screen ball of Kansas City, planned and managed by the Kansas City Screen Club, proved again that the public is intensely interested in moving pictures, and wants to get into closer touch with the industry. It proved, too, that it is keen on seeing screen stars, and wants to get as close to them as possible. The ball had been widely exploited, chiefly through the exhibitors of Kansas City and the neighboring towns. The newspapers gave liberal notices also. The whole country knew that something big was coming off at Convention Hall the night of March 6. And it was big. The floor had been cleared, and a stage erected in the middle thereof, on which the two bands were placed, and where a vaudeville performance was given to open the entertainment. Following the program, the moving picture stars were introduced. Among them were Rose Tapley, Mary Miles Minter, Neil Craig, Vivian Rich, Richard C. Travers, Mr. and Mrs. Bryant Washburn and Crane Wilbur. They also took part in the grand march, and danced with their friends, new or old... That the ball was a success is putting it mildly. It was a triumphant success. There were 6,000 people in the balconies and galleries, looking on. And there were probably 4,000 who occupied boxes and 2,000 spent their entire evening on the floor...

April 15, 1917 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Mary Miles Minter, the Mutual's young star, is heartbroken over the death of her little dog. When, as a mite of a child, Mary made her legitimate reputation in "The Littlest Rebel," J. D. Wooster Lambert, Jr., the Listerine king of St. Louis, presented this clever child actress with a small French poodle, called Woof-Woof. Woof-Woof traveled with its young mistress and, it is said, understood every line and every cue in "The Littlest Rebel." Mary pathetically says that the little dog was put between sheets every night and slept like a baby. This little poodle reigned supreme until Richard A. Rowland, president of the Metro Pictures Corporation, presented Miss Minter, then a Metro star, with a long-pedigreed Pomeranian. These two little dogs, who vied with each other in their devotion to their young mistress, were both poisoned, and all that skill and love could do was to save only the Pomeranian. Poor little Woof-Woof lies buried in Santa Barbara among the roses, and this tiny grave holds a part of the heart of Mary Miles Minter, herself the rarest rose in all the garden.

May 17, 1917 REEL LIFE Mary Miles Minter "the crown princess of the motion picture," as the critics call her, has signed a new two-year contract with the American, and will continue in pictures for Mutual release.

May 26, 1917 EXHIBITOR'S TRADE REVIEW The Turner and Dahnken theatres, the Tivoli, in San Francisco, and the New T. and D., in Oakland, received Mary Miles Minter, the Mutual actress, in person, when her picture, "The Periwinkle," was shown there this week. Her presence in the film playhouse followed a reception she gave to the press of San Francisco. Some of the scenes the reporters saw taken during the week were shown on the Tivoli and T. and D. screens. In the party with the little picture actress were her grandmother, Mrs. Miles; her director, James Kirkwood; Mr. Stout, of the American studio, and Mr. and Mrs. C. L. Langley, the managing director of the Turner and Dahnken circuit, and his wife... At the showing of the picture, Miss Minter spoke a few words to the audience which had received her film with such enthusiasm...

June 24, 1917 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Mary Miles Minter sends word that it is with great regret that she is parting with her director, James Kirkwood, with whom she has worked for the past year. Mary's next picture will be "Charity Castle" in which she appears as a very little girl. This picture will be directed by Lloyd Ingraham.

September 16, 1917 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Mary Miles Minter, with a large company of players, is in the Santa Cruz Mountains for two weeks getting atmosphere for the little star's new American Mutual production, "Peggy Leads the Way," under the direction of Lloyd Ingraham. Miss Minter's sister, Margaret Shelby, is prominent in the cast.

October 21, 1917 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Mary Miles Minter and her compnay, directed by Henry King, have returned to the studio of the American Film Company at Santa Barbara, after spending ten mighty warm days at Hunter's Point in San Francisco Bay filming scenes for "The Mate of the Sally Ann." The unusually hot weather made it difficult for her to keep about all day as a barefoot girl and the burning sun beating upon the deck all day resulted in badly blistered feed for the little screen star. But Miss Minter covered her feet with adhesive plaster and bandaged them when the scenes were over and kept right on with the work.

November 4, 1917 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Liberty Bond Day in Santa Barbara will long be remembered. Word from the Coast states that Mary Miles Minter, accompanied by District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine, who will probably be California's next Governor, were wildly cheered as they motored to the National Bank. Patriotic airs were played by the band and the American Film Company placed flares along the street. Spotlights flashed a benediction on the young star. As she took her place the enthusiasm was so great that for a time her voice could not be heard, a riot seemed imminent...Local papers state that but for the tireless efforts of Mary Miles Minter the maximum quota could not have been secured. As it is, Santa Barbara County totaled a million more than the amount necessary. On Saturday night alone, nearly $100,000 in bonds passed through the hands of Mary Miles Minter. All hail to her!

November 11, 1917 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Los Angeles--The Club of Forty gave its first dinner dance on Halloween and it was unusually successful. Speaking from a cinema standpoint there perhaps has never been an affair which attracted so many distinguished guests and one from which the general public was so carefully and diplomatically eliminated. Mary Pickford was the guest of honor, and Mary Miles Minter ran her a very close second. They both made speeches. George Beban and District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine also addressed the gathering, but both very briefly and to the point. The boys and girls were they for a good time and they certainly had it. Olive Thomas, Mae Murray, Dorothy Dalton, Gail Kane, Adele Rowland, Vivian Martin, Lottie Pickford and so many other beauties were present, and the boys were so dazzled they had to wear tortoise shell cheaters the next day. Among the especially invited guests were District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine, Alfred A. Cohn, Harry Caulfield, Mrs. Shelby, mother of Mary Miles Minter and Mrs. Pickford...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

November 25, 1917 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Los Angeles--...Mary Miles Minter is in town again and this time is stopping at the Hotel Clark which accounts for the popularity of the lobby of that hostelry during the past week. Mary will be the prime mover in a benefit to be given for a Santa Barbara Church during the Christmas holidays. Assisted by a number of people from the American studios she will present two one-act plays, one of which will be William De Mille's satire "Food."

January 13, 1918 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Mr. Camby, who conducts the Photoplay Art, a newspaper which prints pieces and pictures about the actors and actresses, had a popularity contest which ended last week. Mary Miles Minter was the winner. Santa Barbara voted solid for Mary and she won a "fully equipped motor car valued at $1,500." (The quotation marks are Mr. Camby's.) Betty Compson was second and she won a "gorgeous banquet ring containing a sapphire and forty diamonds valued at $500." Doris Baker was third and she won a Victorla "valued at $200." ...The prizes were awarded at a ball given at the Hotel Alexandria. [Photoplay Art was actually published by the American Film Manufacturing Company, so the contest was rigged.]

February 10, 1918 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH A war savings contest has been started in Santa Barbara and the committee has organized what is to be known as the Santa Barbara Schools Thrift League. One of the most active workers is Mary Miles Minter, the American-Mutual's youngest star. A big parade took place February 4, when a half holiday was declared for all the public schools. A band with the Boy Scouts and Cadets escorted the Mayor and other public officials. Mary Miles Minter herself led the parade and awarded the prizes on the green before the Federal building...

March 1918 MOTION PICTURE CLASSIC Mary Miles Minter has been appointed California president of the Children's Patriotic League of America. She will make trips to all the public schools of Southern California and talk to the children about the necessity for helping children of stricken nations. It was due to Miss Minter also that Santa Barbara was able to dispose of her quota of Liberty Bonds, for on the very last day about $30,000 worth remained unsold and Miss Minter made a street campaign in that burg which awakened even the oldest Rip Van Winkle.

September 1918 MOTION PICTURE CLASSIC Mary Miles Minter has taken her company up to Ben Lomon, about sixty miles from 'Frisco, for a three-week's location, doing a play with the fascinating title, "Rosemary Climbs the Heights." Before departing, she spent a day shopping in Los Angeles with Margaret Shelby and Mrs. Shelby in her big blue car with its butterfly on the door.

October 2, 1918 LOS ANGELES HERALD Mary Miles Minter, who has been working daily since the opening of the Fourth Liberty Loan drive in the interests of piling up bond sales, will cease her bond selling activities for two hours tomorrow afternoon in order to devote her time to meeting the patrons of the Kinema Red Cross tea room, where she will be the honor guest from 3 to 5. She will be accompanied by her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, and her sister, Miss Margaret Shelby. Miss Minter, upon finishing her latest feature picture at the American Film studios at Santa Barbara, came down to Los Angeles in time to go out to Long Beach and take care of the bond sales in that city. She piled up a total of $361,800 worth of bond sales in four hours on Saturday afternoon and in the evening added $155,000 worth of sales to this total. Daily since then she has visited the small towns around Los Angeles to aid the Liberty Loan. On Thursday afternoon from 3 to 5, however, she will sip tea and meet all patrons of the tea room at the Kinema theater. Miss Minter was secured to aid the Red Cross through the courtesy of the Mabel Condon exchange.

December 1, 1918 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH On March 27, 1918, Mary Miles Minter, American-Pathe star, christened the big hydroplane, F-1, which was built in Santa Barbara by Allen and Malcolm Loughead, and at the time Miss Minter predicted that the huge man- made bird would some day make Santa Barbara proud of it. It would now seem that her prediction is in a fair way to be realized, as F-1, remodeled as a land plane, left Santa Barbara November 23 for a cross-continent trip to Washington, D. C. Miss Minter and her party gave the F-1A and its crew a royal sendoff and shortly before the official flight was started Miss Minter was a passenger in a trial flight over the city of Santa Barbara. The star was also a passenger on the maiden voyage of hydroplane F-1 over Santa Barbara Channel. Pilot Meyenhoffer carried a letter to President Wilson written by Miss Minter, which read as follows: "To the Honorable Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States, The White House, Washington, D. C. "Our Most Honored President: "I send you greetings from California and take this opportunity to express the appreciation I feel, as a citizen of our wonderful republic, to you, our great and just statesman, who has brought our nation safely through this crisis. "I am not old enough to cast my vote for you, but may I assure you of my loyalty and express the hope that together with my countrymen, I may salute you as our President for another term of years. "Faithfully yours, "Mary Miles Minter."

January 12, 1919 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Ever so often in every motion picture star's life comes up the question of whether to renew the present contract or whether it be better to start something new. This, with apologies to William Shakespeare, is what is happening now in the life of Mary Miles Minter. Miss Mary Miles Minter's contract with the American Film Company expires in May, and just now there is speculation on what Miss Minter intends to do when this said contract expires. Some time ago considerable interest was aroused in the motion picture world by a story stating that D. W. Griffith had made an offer to Samuel S. Hutchinson of the American Film Company to release Miss Minter from her present contract with the American. Naturally, Mr. Hutchinson declined to grant this request, and later also refused to loan Miss Minter for one picture. This, of course, may all be gossip, though it was accepted as the truth when the report came out. If it is true, it may be that Mr. Griffith only wanted Miss Minter for one picture. It has not been the Griffith way to take screen stars trained by any one else for his pictures. He has, with the possible exception of George Fawcett and other stage stars, starred only those screen players who have been trained by himself. Miss Minter has been with the American Film Company for several years and has fared very well at their hands.

May 30, 1919 LOS ANGELES TIMES Mary Miles Minter continues to play in New York--that is the word play being meant in the relative sense of the term. A rumor being current that she was about to sign with Famous Players, this department sent an inquiry back to the blonde star. Said Miss Margaret Shelby, sister of Miss Minter, who, together with their mother, accompanied the star to New York, to the Times representative when he called: "My sister has not yet signed a contract, although she is considering several very fine offers. The prices offered for her services would surprise you if I told you some of the amounts. However, the situation with Juliette (that being the actress's real name) is this: "Juliette told me today that she is thinking seriously of letting a couple of months pass by before affixing her name to any sort of a contract. She needs a rest, you see, and it has been agreed among ourselves that New York City will make the best summer resort that we can think of. We have our pets here and in our new Fifth Avenue home. We have become so delighted with New York and our home that we will stay here for some time to come. Sister has had very little time to rest, having been busy with her long string of engagements. When she started out to perform in pictures a few years ago with the Frohman Amusement Company, we really never thought the time would arrive when she would have to relax a bit."

June 22, 1919 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Mary Miles Minter has signed for three and a half years to star in Realart Pictures. She is the first of the artists to be announced by Realart. It is said that the opportunity to engage Miss Minter was one of the reasons for the formation of Realart Pictures Corporation, of which Arthur S. Kane is president. Immediately after completing late Tuesday afternoon the agreement which has been under negotiation for some weeks Miss Minter left with her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, for Atlantic City for her first vacation in years. She is scheduled to begin work Monday, June 30, in New York City on her first photo-play under the new contract. All of the pictures are to be made by the Mary Miles Minter Productions Company. They will be produced at the rate of six attractions yearly, or a total of twenty productions for the period of the contract. It is stated these are to be made solely from novels and stage successes... The actual signing of Miss Minter's contract was done by her mother, Mrs. Shelby. This was necessary because the youthful star is still several years under age... Under her new engagement Miss Minter will work in New York City for the first time in four years.

June 27, 1919 LOS ANGELES TIMES The little girl with the biggest motion-picture contract in the world--that's Mary Miles Minter. But she pays a stern price for it, inasmuch as her personal life is ordered by the rules laid down in the contract, and she is even forbidden to wed during the life of the agreement. We're always getting a record of the "biggest contract ever signed in motion pictures," and here is Miss Minter's: By its terms she will receive in three years the sum of $1,300,000. She is to get $250,000 for her first five pictures, or $50,000 a picture. For the second five she will get $300,000, or $60,000 a picture, and for the third five $350,000 or $70,000, and for the forth five, $400,000, or $80,000 a picture. No chances were taken with Miss Minter because she happens to be a minor. While she was represented by O'Brien, Malevinsky and Driscoll, the contract was so drawn that her every act will come under the supervision of her employer, Mr. Zukor. A sensational feature provides that, though Miss Minter is but 16 years old, and therefore might be expected to love social gaiety, she is to order her life according to a set of rules which provide she shall live the quietest kind of home life, never be seen in public when it is possible to avoid it, and never associate in public with stage or screen folk. Also--and this might not be pleasing to a lot of screen stars--she is to receive no interviewers. All these terms are new in the screen world, but were adopted years ago in case of some stage stars by Charles Frohman and David Belasco. Maude Adams, as is known, never has been interviewed. On the other hand, tremendous advertising is to be done in Miss Minter's behalf by Mr. Zukor. When Miss Minter went to New York she had no idea she should be able to make such wonderful terms. Selznick made her a very good offer, but Adolph Zukor raised it, then Selznick is reported to have "seen" the offer, but Zukor again outbid him. Then Mrs. Shelby, Mary's mother, suddenly realized what a bonanza her daughter really was, and just let the two men bid against each other as long as they would, under advice of her attorney. Miss Minter's pictures are to be released and sold under the Realart trademark, and the star will commence work June 30. Her company will be known as the Mary Miles Minter productions. The little actress and her mother are now vacationing in Atlantic City, where Miss Minter is enjoying to the full the only free social life she is to be allowed to know during the next three years.

July 26, 1919 EXHIBITOR'S TRADE REVIEW Mary Miles Minter was hostess to a party of distinguished guests at her home on Fifth Avenue, New York, Wednesday night, when she entertained the heads of the Belgian Military Mission to the United States at dinner. The guests included General Leon Ossterieth, head of the Belgian Military Mission, who has been decorated by King Albert 17 times for valor in battle. The general is here preparing for the coming of King Albert to America in the Fall. He is a Knight of the Order of Leopold II and a Knight of the Crown, the two highest honors a Belgian can win. Lieut. William Van Goethern, of the Belgian Army, who has also been decorated, was also in the party...The third member of the party was William Augustus Whiteley, American attache to the Belgian mission. After dinner the entire party attended the performance of the "Midnight Whirl" at the Century Grove, where the officers and their navy decorations and the beauty of Miss Minter attracted unusual attention.

August 3, 1919 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Although Mary Miles Minter has been very active at her New York studios since July 14 preparing for her Realart debut in "Anne of Green Gables," actual work on the production did not begin until last Monday. The two weeks intervening were spent in selecting a cast of supporting players and this was no easy task, as anyone knows who has read the "Anne" stories from which the scenario was made. In starting production on Miss Minter's first Realart picture, her director, William Desmond Taylor, introduced an unusual innovation in photo- play technique. For the first three days not a scene was recorded by the camera. The reason for this was that Mr. Taylor broke away from the conventional method of direction by devoting all this time to rehearsing the star and members of the cast. He believes that in this way the actors will gain a much more thorough understanding of their roles than would be possible under the accepted system of production and will consequently be able to play the parts much better. Miss Minter and her company were slated to leave for Dedham, Mass., the latter part of last week. In the quaint old New England town, where the exteriors for "Anne of Green Gables" will be filmed, the "location scout" of Miss Minter's producing unit found a house that might have been patterned after the one described in the "Anne" stories. It is doubtful if a more suitable spot in the whole of New England could have been found than this as the locale of the stories.

August 17, 1919 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Dedham, Mass., will be the Mecca of New England exhibitors today. From a distance of fifty miles or more around Boston, they will assemble at Dedham for a big picnic, the feature of which will include the filming of several scenes for a photoplay, luncheon, games and the meeting of Mary Miles Minter. Miss Minter, assisted by her company, is to be the hostess of the occasion and the exhibitors will be present in response to invitations personally sent out by the Realart Pictures star. Miss Minter has been in Dedham for about three weeks making scenes for "Anne of Green Gables," under the direction of William Desmond Taylor. Work on the exteriors for the production will be completed at the picnic and it is stated that some of the best scenes have been reserved for the occasion. The picnic is the result of visits which exhibitors have made within the past two weeks to the location where Miss Minter is working. Practically all of the exhibitors who have been in Boston on business recently have made the six-mile trip to Dedham, and, in addition, a large number of Boston exhibitors have been guests of the Minter company. The interest thus manifested suggested to Miss Minter the desirability of giving the picnic. The star, also in response to invitations from leading theatre managers, has visited Boston theatres. Thursday night she made seven personal appearances. Four downtown photoplay houses and three in the Back Bay were included. In each case the star made a short address. It is expected that Miss Minter will resume studio work in New York early next week...

October 14, 1919 LOS ANGELES TIMES Arriving in town yesterday, via the Salt Lake, was Mary Miles Minter, the new bright particular star of Realart. Miss Minter was accompanied by her mother, Mrs. Shelby; by her director, William D. Taylor, and by her secretary, Mrs. Whitney. The star and her mother went at once to the Alexandria, where they will stay until they find a suitable millionaire's home to rent; that is, the home must be suitable. Miss Minter had intended visiting Santa Barbara, her old home, but now she isn't going to, because her two much beloved dogs, which she left when she went to New York, have died. The star will soon start work at the Morosco studio, under direction of Mr. Taylor, on Grace Miller White's story, "Judy of Rogues' Harbor." Miss Minter declares she's very fond of New York, and that she expects to return there next spring. Also she says there's no truth in the report that her contract won't let her marry--so there! "But as I'm only 17 1/2, even if you don't believe me when I tell you that," she laughed, "you'll have to speak to mother about my marrying!" "And it isn't true," she said, "that my contract won't let me appear on the street with a man. In fact, if you had been in New York, you might have seen me many times on Broadway with some one of the nice men of my acquaintance." A dinner was tendered Miss Minter last night at the Alexandria, presided over by Oren F. Woody and Henry L. Massie, members of the Realart organization, at which a number of the newspaper folk of the city were guests. Miss Minter made a very clever little speech, in which she paid a very high compliment to Mary Pickford, whom she stated, was her ideal of all the stars in the picture world.

November 17, 1919 LOS ANGELES HERALD Mary Miles Minter, the Realart Pictures Corporation star, under the direction of William Desmond Taylor, took a day off away from the studio on Monday [November 14] to make the aquatic scenes for "Judy of Rogue's Harbor." Silver Lake was the ideal locale for the many scenes. Little Mary nearly forgot for once that she was a worker, she says. She gave dear old Herbert Standing a thrill by rowing him around the lake and nearly spilling him once or twice, and later she and her story sister, Fritzie Ridgeway, climbed up in a tree to eat their lunch.

December 8, 1919 LOS ANGELES HERALD Fred and Roy Miller, pioneers among western motion picture exhibitors, have long been believers in the motto, "Charity and Success Go Together." Therefore when they decided to reopen their former theater at Main-Spring- Ninth and set the date for Saturday last [December 6], it was not surprising to those who know their charitable inclinations that the first performance was given over to the orphans of the city--those parentless kiddies who depend not largely but solely upon the kindness of other for their childish amusements. The theater management also saw to it that charming little Mary Miles Minter (who might be taken for an orphan herself if her proud mother did not dress her up in nice clothes and motion picture magnates did not insist upon paying her a yearly salary equal to that of the king of England) was on hand to say a few cheery words and give the children a chance to view the living "Anne of Green Gables." It was thoughtful of Mr. Miller and the youngsters showed their appreciation by applauding loudly and lustily, to say nothing of their gasps of astonishment when the real Mary walked before them right after they had watched the reel Mary in L. M. Montgomery's charmingly delightful story picturized by Frances Marion.

December 17, 1919 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Mary Miles Minter, the Realart star, has been rewarded for her hard work during the weeks she has been back at the West Coast studios by official presentation to Governor Stephens of California before a notable gathering of 7,000 people, including exhibitors, stars, directors and others prominent in the motion picture industry. The largest ball held in recent days in Los Angeles was opened by the formal introduction of Miss Minter to Governor Stephens. According to the original plan, Miss Minter was to have opened the ball by dancing with the California executive, but at the last moment it developed that he did not dance. However, the motion picture actress carried off the introductory honors with rare charm, and proved quite equal to the occasion. Miss Minter's box was directly adjoining Governor Stephens's. With the star were her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby; Oren F. Woody, Los Angeles manager for Realart Pictures Corporation, and a party of friends...

December 31, 1919 LOS ANGELES TIMES Mary Miles Minter motored down to Riverside last Saturday, returning on Monday. Of course, she made a personal appearance at the biggest picture house in town--that goes without saying; they never would let her go without showing herself professionally.

February 15, 1920 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH In recognition of the prominent place which the motion picture industry has won in the estimation of California business men, Mary Miles Minter was chosen as the guest of honor at a luncheon at the Alexandria Hotel, given recently by the Advertising Club of Los Angeles More than 300 of the prominent business men of the city attended the luncheon, which was the occasion for boosting "A Greater Los Angeles in
1920." Among the prominent speakers were Dr. J. A. B. Scherer, president of Troop College, Pasadena; John P. Carter, Internal Revenue Collector; John F. Murray, United States Investigator in Europe of child conservation, and Motley H. Flint, vice president of the Los Angeles Trust and Savings Bank. Miss Minter was not only the guest of honor but the sole representative on the program of the motion picture industry...On the program Miss Minter was listed as "the fastest ascending luminary of the film firmament of this era. Her Realart contract calls for $1,200,000 for twenty pictures. This prepossessing little star is a wonderful speaker. We remember her effective work in Liberty Loan campaigns." Miss Minter's speech dwelt upon the great progress made in recent years in Los Angeles business affairs, but called attention to the still pressing need for more and larger buildings and housing conveniences. She praised the various department stores and business houses and congratulated Los Angeles business men on furnishing the motion picture industry with facilities for buying commodities and clothing equal to New York City. In the same week, Miss Minter motored from Los Angeles to San Diego to make personal appearance at the Plaza Theatre, where "Anne of Green Gables" was having a week's run. W. W. Whitson, proprietor of the theatre, made the arrangements for the visit. Miss Minter made the trip accompanied by her mother and sister. The party was entertained that afternoon aboard the U. S. S. Ingraham, a destroyer. At the theatre one of the boxes was decorated for Miss Minter and her party, a large electrical star being placed over it. Miss Minter related in her speech a number of the amusing or difficult situations that arose during the making of "Anne of Green Gables" last summer at Dedham, Mass.

March 25, 1920 LOS ANGELES TIMES Tripping up to the hospital and to the bedside of David Warfield yesterday, bearing an armful of flowers, was no less a person than Mary Miles Minter, who is an old friend of Mr. Warfield. The flowers were half the gift of Miss Minter and half that of Marcus Loew who as soon as he heard of Warfield's accident, telegraphed Miss Minter to purchase flowers and send the bill to him. Miss Minter did so, and sent half the bill, or maybe no bill at all, but the card on the big nosegay bore both names. Miss Minter promised to "come again," and when she does she's going to take the great actor a box of fudge made by her own fair hands.

April-May 1920 MOTION PICTURE Charlotte Whitney, the Santa Barbara girl who built up Mary Miles Minter's publicity office from one room and Charlotte to four rooms and three secretaries (who mailed three thousand or more pictures weekly) is the proud mother of a little girl named for Mary--that is, of course, "Juliet Shelby Whitney"--taking Miss Minter's very own names. The latter is so proud of her godchild that at Christmas she had a tree for the three-week's old infant--a perfectly gorgeous affair--in her Fremont Square residence. Mr. Whitney is in business in Santa Barbara and lives with his mother-in- law and the first child, a boy, and Charlotte remains in Hollywood with Mary, who has engaged a special nurse for small Juliet so that Mrs. Whitney may give her usual skillful attention to the Minter publicity, answering of fan letters, and mailing of pictures. Grandmother Miles and Margaret Shelby are still in New York, but Mrs. Shelby, Mary Miles Minter and Mrs. Whitney keep house here. Mrs. Whitney and the infant are making week-end trips frequently to see the other half of the family.

August 24, 1920 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Film Love Ends in Prison Term

Visions of work by the side of a beautiful motion picture actress brought him to Los Angeles. Too much imagination, fired by stories he had seen in the films of "reds" and "revolution" landed him in jail. Mike Serjack, 18 years old, saw Mary Miles Minter in every film in which she starred at the "picture show" in his native Ohio village. He longed for the chance to see his pictured inamorata in the flesh, to talk to her. Surely, he though, she would understand. Perhaps, if he told her she would give him a job, just any little job working with her in the films. The "picture show" proprietor told him that most motion picture stars lived in Los Angels, and Mike saved his pennies to come out to the Coast. In July he found he had enough. "In order to get into the films you must do somethin' unusual to git their attention," some one who pretended to know told him before he reached Los Angeles. What would be "unusual?" What would make the fair Mary Miles Minter smile upon him? Mike pondered. He formed a plan. Painfully, and with much biting of his pencil, he managed to compose the following note which he put in the mail box the day after he arrived in the city: "Dear Miss Minter: Your home is attempted to be robbed or destroyed by red radicals. I overheard their plans. The reds will attempt bombing or kidnapping. I can prevent it if you come to the Santa Fe depot tomorrow and tell me where you live so I can guard you. Please come with your mother for your sake." With his letter Mike enclosed a crudely printed note which was supposed to have been stolen, at great risk to his life, from one of the "reds," explaining, in much veiled language, their plot against Mary. No one came to the Santa Fe station. But Mike meanwhile had found out where his heroine lived, 56 Fremont Place. Friday morning he knocked out a couple of teeth, otherwise made himself look like the veteran of a hard fight, and threw himself, feigning unconsciousness, in the bushes near the Minter home. To save her life he had given battle to the "reds," you see. But instead of the fair Mary a newspaper delivery boy found Mike. He called a police ambulance. Mike was taken to the police station where Detective Sergeants Finlison, Slaughter and Hurt arrested him on complaint filed several days previous by no less a person than Mary Miles Minter. Yesterday Judge Richardson, anxious to make an example to "filmstruck youth," sentenced Mike to six months in the city jail. But even as he was being led to his cell it is doubtful if Mike realized why. All he knew was that he had done the unusual, but it had not been appreciated. Would the world--and Mary--never understand?

December 1920 PHOTOPLAY Ten thousand dollars was raised for the Disabled Soldiers of the Great War at a ball given in September at the Alexandria in Los Angeles by the Motion Picture Directors' Association. The affair was exceedingly gorgeous in the appointment and entertainment and the 700 people who gathered represented the elite of Los Angeles society as well as of the Hollywood film colony. William D. Taylor, feature director for Realart, was in charge of the entertainment, and presented some unique stunts. Doraldina did her fascinating hula-hula; Tom Mix and twenty of his cowboys in full regalia pulled a fake hold-up and separated the crowd from its spare cash; Larry Semon paid $500 for a bat and ball autographed by Babe Ruth, and Ben Hampton gave a like amount for a pair of crutches belonging to one of the wounded heroes present--and then returned the crutches. Over in one corner was a booth marked "For Men Only" at a dollar a man, which caused a good deal of excitement, but rumor hath it that it was a blank. Among those who graced the dance and the wonderful supper served at midnight were Wanda Hawley, Jeanie MacPherson, Ruth Roland, Lois Wilson, Mr. and Mrs. Conrad Nagel, Mary Miles Minter, who entertained a party of twelve, Tony Moreno with a number of society people from Beverly Hills, Pauline Frederick and her mother, Bebe Daniels, Mr. and Mrs. Tom Forman, Elliott Dexter, Mr. and Mrs. Wally Reid, Mr. and Mrs. Charlie Eyton (Kathlyn Williams), Irene Rich, Margaret Loomis, King Vidor and his wife, Florence Vidor, May Allison, Viola Dana, Colleen Moore, Mr. and Mrs. Jack Holt, Priscilla Dean and Wheeler Oakman, Mr. and Mrs. Willard Louis, Mary Alden, and William Duncan and Edith Johnson.

April 15, 1921 LOS ANGELES TIMES If there's one thing which may be considered irresistible to the feminine heart, it's a uniform. And now Mary Miles Minter is proving that even so cool a little head as hers isn't proof against its lure. Miss Minter gave a perfectly lovely party Wednesday for officers of the New York. She was assisted in entertaining by Miss Lois Wilson. There was a horseback riding party in the morning, at Beverly Hills, then a luncheon, followed by a bathing party at the beach, and dinner and dancing in the evening at a local cafe. One mishap marred the day's joy. That was when Gaston Glass, the young actor, who is to portray the lead in Miss Minter's next picture, slightly injured his side in performing a diving feat during the bathing festivities. Mr. Glass was thereafter unable to drive his car, but as Miss Wilson drove it for him, it is likely that his sufferings were considerably lightened. Other members of the party were Capt. Blaydon, Dana Todd and Jack Donovan...

According to present plans the Realart luminary will finish her current picture, "Her Winning Way," and leave Los Angeles in time to board the "Imperator" sailing from New York June 2. The first stop will be London. Paris and Ostend will be visited by airplane followed by a flying trip over the battlefields to Lake Lucerne, Switzerland. Venice, Naples, Florence, Rome and the Riviera are in the itinerary, not to forget a motor tour up through the Chateau country of France and short dip into Spain. Accompanying Miss Minter will be her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby and her sister, Margaret, who will combine business with pleasure by gathering ideas for the home-building firm which she owns and manages.

June 2, 1921 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Mary Miles Minter is going abroad, and like any girl of her age, she is properly thrilled. At a luncheon at the Hotel Biltmore she entertained about twenty representatives from the newspapers and motion picture periodicals who assembled to wish her "bon voyage." The plans for her trip have been made as carefully as those of a visiting diplomat, for she will be a messenger representing the city of Los Angeles bearing greetings from the Mayor of that city to many important personages abroad, including the Lord Mayor of London, the Permier of France and King Albert of the Belgians. Besides these her visiting list shows such names as Jenny, Poiret and Paquin, also Coty, Houbigant and Gelle Freres. The after-luncheon speeches were a bit like the old game of "Up Jenkins." First S. Jay Kaufman called upon Mary for a speech, but she, in a few firm and gracious words, declined, passing the honor back to him. S. J. called upon Mr. Dannenburg, and Joseph Dannenburg on James, who was once press representative for Miss Minter, and from him it jumped to Bide Dudley, the well known columnist of the World. Mr. Dudley told a story about the last speech he had heard Mary Miles Minter make. "It was at Palisades Park one day," he said. "I was tossing rings at a booth when I heard a childish voice behind me say, 'Dimme dat Teddy bear,' and there was Mary. The sailing date is set for the Fourth, on the Olympic. Miss Minter will be accompanied by her mother and sister. She expects to be gone about four months.

July 13, 1921 LOS ANGELES HERALD Formal and emphatic denial that Mary Miles Minter, local moving picture star, now on tour in Europe, is to marry Orville Erringer of Portland, Ore., was made today by Mrs. Julia B. Miles, 701 South New Hampshire street, Miss Minter's grandmother. "You may state that reports to the effect Miss Minter is to marry Mr. Erringer or anyone else, for that matter, are absolutely false," said Mrs. Miles today. "Mr. Erringer was brought to our home some time ago and there met Mary. Their acquaintance was very slight; certainly not enough to base an engagement rumor on. Mary is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles on or about Aug. 23 and will at once start on a picture for the Realart people. I receive letters from her constantly and in none of them has she even mentioned matrimony." The report of the engagement is said to have emanated from the home of Erringer's parents in Paris, Ky. Erringer is 21 years of age and northwestern manager of a California fruit packing corporation.

August 1, 1921 LOS ANGELES EXPRESS In the absence of Mary Miles Minter and mother in Europe it was left for Grandma Shelby to deny the story sent out from Paris, Ky., that the star is to marry Orville Erringer of Portland, Ore. 'Tis a far cry from Paris to Portland, but it was explained that the "news" came to Kentucky in a letter. Young Erringer is grandson of a former Parisian (the glue grass kind) who was manager of the local branch of the Western Union Telegraph Company. So Paris got it first. Other details of happy fiance: Age 21; is Portland manager for a California fruit packing concern; son of a traveling representative of a motor car company; met Mary in Hollywood. Grandma Shelby says it is only a "schoolgirl romance," and that "Mary soon recovers from them."

The actress was nabbed first by Motorcycle Officer Jesse at Wilshire boulevard and Wilton place and the second time by Motorcycle Office Bandle at Fourteenth and Main streets. She was charged with speeding and operating a car without a license in each case and deposited bail to the amount of $40.

December 11, 1921 Frances Agnew NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Los Angeles--The writers staged their first annual cramp, a jolificiation, not a cause for a doctor--last Thursday evening at the Hotel Ambassador. Film historians take note! For it was a party to be recorded as perhaps the greatest single social gathering of literary and professional celebrities sever staged. They've had them all in a theatre at one time, but probably never at one dinner before. That old phrase, "The guest list reads like the 'Who's Who in Literature and Filmland'," has been abused until applied to this affair. And just for good measure, as well as to prove their magnetism, no doubt, the writers added the blue book of Los Angeles society to their roster, and they were all there in full force, marcel waves, low cut gowns and dress suits. The writers' cramp was really the "coming out" party of the Screen Writers' Guild organized here as a branch of the Authors' League of America some sixteen months ago, the proceeds of the lavish dinner dance and original entertainment to be used to equip the writers' new club house on sunset boulevard. The first cramp was staged with a decidedly novel entertainment "scenario," its biggest "situations" being a satirical act from the uncensored pen of Thompson Buchanan, titled, "Lo, the Poor Writer, or Father's Sin," a four-round boxing bout between Bert Lynch and Eddie Coffey, featherweights, and a battle royal of five fighters representing the pioneer scenario writers, the fight to determine who wrote the first motion picture scenario. The lone woman won the fray, her only identification on the program being a few question marks followed by this note: "Hush! Courtesy prohibits using the name of a lady associated with so remote a date of ancient history." The Rev. Neal Dodd was toastmaster, though his speech and those of Frank E. Woods, Thompson Buchanan, George Foster Platt, master of ceremonies; George Ade and others were "cut" because they could not be heard above the clatter and chatter of the diners. "Father's Sin" held the limelight. It was an uncensored travesty on film making, interpreted by Tully Marshall as the director, Theodore Roberts, assistant director; Noah Beery, cameraman, Mary Miles Minter, assistant cameraman; William H. Crane, "props"' Sylvia Breamer, vampire; Enid Bennett, leading lady; Bert Lytell, leading man; Herbert Rawlinson, villain; Lionel Belmore as the owner of the company, whose name, Mr. O'Flaherty, didn't match his accent a-tall; Mayme Kelso as an "extra," and Roy Atwell as the abused author...

January 7, 1922 NEW YORK GLOBE Mary Miles Minter Denies Engagement

Denial that she was engaged to marry T. P. Dixon of New York was made this week by Mary Miles Minter, star in Paramount pictures, in a telegram to her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby. Miss Minter's telegram follows: "As there are the holidays an open season for all sorts of wedding and engagement rumors, let's be cheerful and round out the year with last denial. That's seven for 1921. Say for me I am not engaged, married, or out of a job." "Although I knew it to be a waste of time," said Mrs. Shelby, "I wired Mary about this latest rumor. The last previous rumor had Mary engaged to Orville Erringer of Chicago, and was circulated while we were in Europe. The story was given wide publicity, while later denials were not so prominently displayed. Mary has hosts of friends, but has not at any time considered any one of them as a possible husband." Mrs. Shelby has left for Hollywood to join her daughter, who is now engaged in producing "The Heart Specialist" in the Lasky studio.

May 13, 1922 MOVIE WEEKLY "Oh, but did you hear about Bebe Daniels' back-fire at Mary Miles Minter! It seems that Mary had very deeply offended Bebe by saying something awfully catty to her at a party one night right before everybody. Well, Bebe is the sweetest girl in the world, and beloved by everybody, but she won't stand everything. "It all happened out at Lottie Pickford's wedding, while the audience was gossiping the way a crowd always does while they're waiting for the holy bans of matrimony to be pronounced, and before the bride and groom come gliding down the aisle. Mary Minter was calling across to Mary Pickford, 'You know, on my second trip to Europe--' and then went on, sort of showing off. It all began to get on Bebe's nerves. She called across to Lila Lee-- 'Oh, dearie, do you remember our seventh trip to Europe?' 'Oh, no,' Lila played right up, 'it wasn't our seventh trip; it was our ninth trip!' The crowd around was listening by this time, and Mary Minter had begun to blush, realizing that she was being kidded.

June 1922 CAPT. BILLY'S WHIZ BANG The two film actresses mentioned so often in connection with the Taylor murder will each go abroad but in different directions. Mabel Normand has announced her intention of soon going to Europe for a prolonged stay. Mary Miles Minter has already left for the Orient. A very few months ago, Mary's engagement was announced to T. E. Dixon, you remember. He is the son of the millionaire pencil manufacturer. However, since the Taylor affair entangled Mary and disclosed a very frank and schoolgirly letter she had once written to him--which any of us might have done in our young teen days!--Dixon is no longer seen calling at Mary's home. It is said that he broke the engagement and that Mrs. Shelby, Mary's mother, is prostrated with grief...

October 1922 PHOTOPLAY After having survived six weeks of strenous location activities for "The Cowboy and the Lady," Mary Miles Minter was knocked about her private car when a switch engine jolted it near Victor, Idaho, sustaining severe cuts and numerous scratches and bruises. Tom Moore, Mary's leading man, received severe bruises about the head. The actors were waiting to start their railroad journey back to Los Angeles when the accident occurred. The unfeeling director was doubtless relieved that the actors had completed their roles in the picture before the smash happened.

October 15, 1922 Frances Agnew NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Hollywood, Oct. 9--For the second time the capitol of filmland has hit the gong for the benefit of the Actors' Fund of America, that splendid, professional cause which Daniel Frohman so ably and tirelessly heads. Last year the motion picture branch of the fund was established by the proceeds from an all-day carnival and gorgeous pageant given by the film folk at the Los Angeles Speedway. This year it was augmented by a large share of the gross receipts from a spectacularly beautiful performance of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream." This was staged Saturday night in the Hollywood Bowl, under the auspices of the Motion Picture Directors' Association. And when standing at the side, gazing over the sea of more than 10,000 faces that lined the graceful hills of the Bowl and glancing over the hundreds of celebrated names on the program, one reflected that nowhere else in the world, perhaps, could there be assembled such a wealth of beauty, luxury and talent. About 90 per cent of the "Who's Who in Filmdom" were on the program, playing important roles, "suping" with spears, strolling past in the pageant, or out in the audience and driveways selling programs and acting as ushers. The other 10 per cent, were in the boxes for which they paid as high as $200, or in the $10 or $15 seats, giving the rest of the gigantic audience a double treat in their propinquity. In the picturesque theatre, which had the stars for its canopy and the full moon for its chandelier, with a lovely green-covered and tree-studded hill for the backdrop of its broad stage, on which dozens of colored spotlights were turned throughout the performance, the principal roles of Shakespeare's fantastic comedy were played by Enid Bennett, who was a queenly Titania; Conrad Nagel, a romantic Oberon; Viola Dana, who frolicked delightfully as Puck; Mary Miles Minter as the lovely Helena; Thomas Holding as Demetrius; Shirley Mason as a fiery and winsom little Herminia; William Desmond as a dominating Lysander; Stuart Holmes as Theseus; Louise Dresser as Hippolyta; Patsy Ruth Miller as a fairy; with Francis Powers, Charles Newton, Wallace Reid, William Russell, Gertrude Astor, Cullen Landis, Gaston Glass and Dick Sutherland in incidental bits. The individual "hits" of the evening were scored by the five comedians, Charles Ray, who seemed to be having a good time and entertaining others, too, as Flute, the bellows mender; Larry Semon, who cavorted as Snug, the joiner and played the lion in their burlesque; Wilson Hummell as Quince; Mitchell Lewis as Snout; Otis Harlan as a mirth-provoking Starveling, and, especially, by Lionel Belmore , whose performance as Bottom brought him repeated applause. Then there were the fairies led by Jackie Coogan, Baby Peggy, Gertrude Messinger, Bob Alexander and Johnny Jones, with dozens of tiny screen kiddies braving the chilly night in their filmy garments to add the exquisitely lighted scenes in the forest. And every one of them were "ever in the picture," even the tiniest, who grew tired of pirouetting and dashed off to the wings with a cry of "Oh, daddy," at a very fantastic moment in the play. And the pageant. It was interpolated in the first act to give the vast audience a chance to see more of their favorites than Shakespeare's cast permitted. The pity of it all, however, was that the plan to announce the stars as they passed in review by electric signs apparently failed to carry and there were few, even among the professionals in the audience, who could recognize the pageant beauties in their classic costumes. In the pageant were Frank Beal, William Farnum, Claire Windsor, Edna Purviance, Jane Novak, Lottie Pickford, Kathlyn Williams, Marie Prevost, Ruth Roland, Mae Busch, Helene Chadwick, Anna Q. Nilsson, Carmel Myers, Florence Vidor, Wanda Hawley, Mae Murray, Lois Wilson, Bebe Daniels, Agnes Ayres, Dorothy Phillips, Priscilla Dean and last, but by no means least, Pola Negri. However, when Miss Negri doffed her headdress and covered her Cleopatra costume with a gorgeous ermine cape, she appeared in Daniel Frohman's box, where Charlie Chaplin, Mary O'Connor, Jesse L. Lasky, Marion Fairfax and Josephine Quirk were among his other guests and, needless to say, the audience passed and repassed that particular point to glimpse the famous Polish star and the comedian. Mr. Chaplin's contribution to the performance was one of its biggest hits. With his hair ruffled and the baton in his left hand, he conducted the orchestra in Mendelssohn's "Spring Song" after the second act... [This was probably Minter's last stage performance.]

December 9, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXPRESS Jesse L. Lasky and the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation have severed all connections with Mary Miles Minter, one of its most prominent screen stars, according to an announcement made public in New York today. "Miss Minter is working on 'The Trail of the Lonesome Pine,' which will close her contract with us," remarked Secretary Goodwin of the executive offices. "It has been understood for some time that this picture would terminate her services." Later it was stated to Jesse L. Lasky that Miss Minter expected to return to the stage and that she is completing negotiations with a theatrical corporation in New York City with that end in view. Mr. Lasky, first vice president of the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation announced: "The contract with Mary Miles Minter and the Famous Player-Lasky Corporation, which has extended over a period of approximately three years, was for a certain number of pictures, the last of which is that upon which she is at present engaged, 'The Trail of the Lonesome Pine.' "I understand that Miss Minter has made her plans for an appearance on Broadway, which will mark her return to the spoken drama, where she was so successful before entering on motion picture activities. "It may be that her popularity is not sufficient to warrant the tremendous expense in finding pictures starring her. As the action was taken at New York I can not authoritatively discuss it." Efforts to communicate with Miss Minter were futile, but it was announced at the office of her attorney that Miss Minter does not intend to retire from the screen, in spite of the action of the Famous Players-Lasky officials.
