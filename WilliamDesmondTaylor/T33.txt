But because it happened so far from home, the blame was primarily shifted to the decadent environment of the night life in Paris. A few weeks after her death, a special memorial service was held in Hollywood; the memorial oration was delivered by William Desmond Taylor.[1] The following items trace her life, film career, and tragic death. Not mentioned are the rumors that for a time she was the mistress of Florenz Ziegfeld. She also had posed nude for Alberto Vargas; his memorial painting "Memory of Olive Thomas" has been reprinted several times.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 15, 1920 NEW YORK CLIPPER Olive Elain Duffy Thomas was born at Charleroi, Pa., October 20, 1898. Her family name was Duffy. She was educated in the public schools of Pittsburgh and, at the age of 15, left school to work in a department store. After working a short time she came to New York. Here she posed for Harrison Fisher and other artists, her Irish type of beauty attracting many to her. A letter of recommendation form Harrison Fisher to Flo Ziegfeld resulted in her obtaining a position in the "Midnight Frolic" in 1914 and she continued appearing in the Ziegfeld shows until 1917. Then she left the stage for the screen... Her first husband, from whom she obtained a divorce, was Bernard Krug Thomas, of Pittsburgh, now employed as a timekeeper in a steel mill. She married Jack Pickford in the fall of 1917... Besides her husband, Miss Thomas is survived by her mother, Mrs. Harry Vankirk of Philadelphia, two brothers, James and William Duffy, who are connected with the Selznick studios here, and a five year old sister, Harriet Duffy.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 1925 Terry Ramsaye PHOTOPLAY ...Olive Thomas had no girlhood. She was born as Oliveretta Duffy, and grew up in a depressing, smoky Pennsylvania industrial atmosphere. She married into that life of grime, labor and sweat--a life unbearable. That marriage was a desperately unhappy one. The girl fled to New York, taking refuge in a cousin's household in Harlem. She haunted the streets of uptown New York looking for work and found it at last behind a basement counter in a department store. She had escaped the grime of Pittsburgh for the grind of a shop-girl in an inferior market. Then came one of those bits of Aladdin magic which are the lure of New York. A newspaper bidding for shop-girl circulation announced that Howard Chandler Christy, the famous artist, was holding a competition for a perfect model, the supreme New York beauty. There were prizes to be awarded, and the glory of having one's picture in the paper. Oliveretta Duffy had recovered a bit from the depressions of Pittsburgh, and there was a radiant Irish beauty just back of her eyes, ready to bloom. She took a chance, reported sick at the store and in her pathetic best clothes went downtown to the Christy studio to sit waiting with the throng of ambitious. It was a convention of the piquant beauties of the New York shop girl. Every race of the metropolitan melting pot was represented in that array. Oliveretta Duffy won, the prize, the picture in the paper, the publicity, everything. Now over in Broadway Florenz Ziegfeld was engaged in his business of "glorifying the American girl" per the "Follies." His merchandise was and is feminine beauty, preferably famous beauty. Here was youth and beauty, with a brand new fame in the papers. Oliveretta Duffy went to the Follies and burst into fame as Olive Thomas. She was a sudden sensation, the toast of Broadway. Strong men grew dizzy under her eyes. She was overwhelmed with admiration and gifts of treasure, diamond necklaces, pendants, rings, parties, orchids, everything that the dreaming little shop girl might fancy on the screen of her imagination. It was even whispered about that the great Bernstorff, the German ambassador, had sent Miss Thomas a ten thousand dollar string of pearls. On the wave of adulation Miss Thomas was signed by Triangle Pictures Corporation for the screen...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * July 1, 1916 MOTOGRAPHY Olive Thomas, of the Ziegfeld "Midnight Frolic," has joined the International Film Company forces as leading woman for Harry Fox in comedies.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 15, 1916 VARIETY Olive Thomas of the Ziegfeld Follies has been engaged for the tenth episode of "Beatrice Fairfax."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * April 14, 1917 MOTOGRAPHY Follies Girl With InceThomas H. Ince has engaged Olive Thomas, the popular young star of the Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic and featured beauty of a late edition of the Follies, to create important roles in forthcoming Kay-Bee productions. Miss Thomas is now in California, and has already been assigned the lead in one of the first plays that Ince will do under his new arrangement with Triangle. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, about twenty years ago, Olive Thomas became a reigning favorite on Broadway from the night--or morning--that the Ziegfeld Frolic opened, about two years ago, and with the exception of one season when she played the January girl in the 1916 premiere of the Follies, she has been the bright particular star of the revels that have attracted thousands to the top of the New Amsterdam theater. A brunette of the vivacious type, Miss Thomas has grey eyes and golden brown hair that screens unusual well. Despite all of the attention of which she has been the center, she is said to be as simple and charming in manner as though she had never known success. All of the former members of her company have sent her telegrams of congratulation upon her affiliation with Ince, which is a mark of popularity few Broadway beauties can match. Miss Thomas made her screen debut a few months ago with Irene Fenwick in the Paramount production of "A Girl Like That," in which she created an excellent impression. Ince will cast her in roles that will give full play to her sunny and whimsical personality.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * December 1917 PHOTOPLAY It is no longer a great mystery-secret, that Jack Pickford-Olive Thomas romance. On October 25, the former Follies star announced that just a year before on the same date, she and Jack were married, prior to Jack's departure for the Coast. Then in the spring Olive quit the bright lights for the sunlight and became a Triangle luminary. She made no secret to friends that it was on Jack's account. But news of the marriage was kept from the public because, as the beauteous Olive says, "I didn't want people to say that I'm succeeding because of the Pickford name." Now that she has "shown 'em", Miss Thomas is not averse to letting the world know that she and Jack have been one for one year...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * December 1917 Jack Lloyd PHOTOPLAY A Broadway Queen Gone West ...No one is more popular in the big "lot" at Culver City. In tailored suit and jaunty cap. she strolls about, with a pert offering or a ready reply for everyone. It is one of the legends of the studios that no one can "get ahead" of Olive Thomas in repartee, and no situation is too unusual for her to puncture it with a pungent comment... "You know," confided Olive naively, I'd rather eat Boston beans and butter cakes in Childs than the most expensive mess the French chef can dope out in Broadway's most expensive lobster palace." Which is quite some confession. Also, it is added proof of Olive's lack of upstaginess. "Life's too short and fate too funny to get upstage," philosophized Olive. "Today they may be showering us with roses on Broadway and tomorrow some fool director who used to be a waiter may be rejecting us as atmosphere in a five reel five cent feature..."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 21, 1917 VARIETY Jack Pickford, returning from a party at four a.m. Sept. 9, Los Angeles, in his machine, with Olive Thomas, Catherine Walker, Mr. and Mrs. William Gordon and Jack Dillon, crashed into a light truck, demolishing the truck and upsetting the Pickford car and its occupants. Pickford was taken to University police station. The driver of the truck suffered lacerations about the face and body, a fractured hand and concussion of the brain. The occupants of the Pickford car escaped with cuts, scratches and bruises.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 1918 PHOTOPLAY Even famous beauties are not immune from the ills which the common herd is heir to. Olive Thomas, whom an enthusiastic Coast exhibitor bills as "The Raving Beauty of the Follies," was away from the Triangle studio for nearly two weeks with an ulcerated tooth. She returned without it.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 1918 Herbert Howe MOTION PICTURE CLASSIC Can a Beauty Have Brains?"A beauty never has brains," so sayeth she who may boast the latter but hasn't the face to claim the former. "The Motion Picture industry is a business without brains," so lamenteth he who claims the brains but can't get away with the business. Somebody at some time got up a rule to the effect that two negatives equal a positive; so if you put these two minus quantities together, the theoretical result ought to be brains, eh? But possibly the rule does not apply to this syllogism. Furthermore, the latter premise isn't well established, for there are some who refuse to classify the fifth largest industry in the world as a mastodon with a cavity where its cerebrum should be; altho incontrovertible proof has been established, it is said, by certain sleight-of-hand financiers and scriveners of penny-a-word reams. One truth shines out self-evident: there ARE beauties in the business. One of the latest recruits to this army of crippled intellects is Olive Thomas, who, coming as she does from the musical-comedy stage, cannot be considered a high- brow of the type that wears bone-rims and talks about "the masses." But what she lacks in mentality she makes up in diviner form. Praise to Allah! And what she may now know about the industry she does not reveal by writing, but instead has demonstrated an appalling inquisitiveness to find out. A blithe young hurricane could not have created more disturbance than did Ollie that bright morning when she swept thru the gates of the Triangle studio in her shining motor-car. Question-marks sparkled in both eyes! In two hours she knew the nicknames of every man, dog and "prop" on the lot. In two weeks she was ready to direct, turn the camera or design sets. "Madcap" some called her, by virtue of the appropriate title of her first play. "Pep" was another sobriquet. But the director who was given charge of the feminine dynamo preferred "Miss Inquisitive." Every day during the course of production he was volleyed with such questions as: "What do you do that for? Why can't I weep real tears instead of glycerine ones? Why do some actresses smell an onion when they want to cry? Onions make me sneezy, not weepy." The eternal question-mark that punctuated all her utterances became the terror of more than one expert. Soon it became the practice to explain to Miss Ollie all the intricacies of a production before she had a chance to commence her "third degree." In four weeks she was capable of turning her hand to anything, from taming a wild animal--or director--to building the sets. "Why the thirst for knowledge?" she was asked. "Well, you see, I'm only a 'Follies' girl, and may turn out a flivver star in pictures, so I'd better be prepared for a carpenter's job if necessary. Oh, by the way, why-----" But the other party to the colloquy fled as the question-mark flashed thru the air, and Ollie was left to solve the problem which she had suddenly conjured up. Her interrogative exuberance finally caused the scenario editor to lay down his arms and give her a place at his typewriter, where she proceeded to collaborate on a play. For several days her inquisitiveness was quelled. She wrote with two fingers, and soon wanted to know how she could write with all ten and at the same time be legible. When the play was ready for production and Olive, with her supporters, was removed to the mountains for filming the most important scenes, she inquired if she might direct. Of course that was out of the question. No actress has brains enough to direct. Why, some gentlemen who have never been on a lot say that regular directors haven't enough brains to do it, so how could an ex-"Follies" girl? "But why not?" retorted the irrepressible girl one. Finally, in sheer desperation, the company and director signed a petition asking that Queen Question be given a chance at the megaphone. Thereupon, the electric energies of the young star fairly shot sparks. She directed with a zeal that caused one of the players to moan, "Oh, Lord! it's going to be a regular Keystone--speed--speed--speed! She's a demon for action. Does she ever rest long enough to do anything but ask 'why?' or 'how?'" Olive's avocation came to a sudden and almost disastrous end. She was directing a scene with all the fierceness of a Simon Legree, when a snake ambled up and, as though bewitched by the charmer, curled up affectionately at her feet, with his neck upstretched. "Madcap" gave a wild scream, did a leap that would have made Fairbanks look paralyzed, and shot down the mountainside like a forty-centimeter shell, exploding as she went. When the director in charge overtook her, she was breathless, but soon recovered enough to say: "Where did that infernal thing come from? Did he bite me? Was the scene spoiled? What kind of a snake was it? Do you think there are many more around here? Will you--will you finish directing that scene?" "Yes! I don't know, but I think so. YES!" shouted the director. Olive returned meekly to her duties as star, and for several days had no questions to ask. Then she suddenly had a desire to pick the next location. By that time the question-riddled crowd offered no resistance. She went forth to explore. Hours passed and the fair Columbus returned not. "We'd better hunt for her," suggested one of the men. "If you do, she'll ask why you did it," shrieked one of the women. Toward sundown Olive returned looking as though she had done an Annette Kellermann without heeding the maternal advice anent hanging one's clothes on a hickory limb.[2] "Where on earth have you been?" chorused the company. "And where on earth did you gather so many wet clothes?" "Why be so deuced inquisitive?" retorted the dripping young person. "I was looking around, when a lake got under my foot and went up over my head, and I thought I'd found my last location. That night one of her pet Japanese poodles wandered forth, presumable in search of the location which Olive had failed to find--due to the lake getting in her way. The mistress discovered the dog's absence, became worried, and finally insisted on organizing a search-party for him. The tired associates, fearful of the eternal "why?" trailed forth, but the canine explorer could not be found. He turned in during the wee hours of the morning, stuck full of burs and looking as though he had enjoyed a rough and riotous night. "Where do you suppose he has been?" asked one of the players. "You reprimand me for asking questions," retorted Olive, "and yet you would ask a gentleman that. Chow-chow," said she, addressing the accused, "you need not answer. The question is irrelevant, impertinent, no bearing on the case. Don't commit yourself. But you do look like you'd been sitting in a patch of burs." "More likely in a hand of poker with an ace up his fur," grumbled one of those who had comprised the search-party, as the surveyed the dissipated- looking poodle. Olive returned to the studio declaring that she had spent the most glorious time of her life up in the mountains, and that she had almost learnt to write poetry from gazing over the clouds that clustered around the mountain ridges. Instead of being called Miss Inquisitive, she now has the title of Miss Encyclopedia at the studio. When a visitor--a very dignified and commanding woman--called at the studio not long ago, she was escorted to the stage where the star was working. The lady made several inquiries which puzzled the guide, so he referred her to the director. "Turn her over to Miss Encyclopedia. She knows," replied that gentleman. Olive, who at that moment was draped over a chair watching a festive cabaret scene and propounding a question under her her curl-frescoed head, obliged. "What is that the players are drinking?" asked the visitor. "Champagne," promptly replied Miss Encyclopedia. "Do tell!" exclaimed the woman, raising her lorgnette to scrutinize the effervescent liquor. Then she hurried away. Shortly after Olive was summoned to appear in the manager's office. "What did you tell this lady that the players were drinking?" she was asked, sternly. "Champagne." "But you know they are not. This lady is a prohibitionist, and she accuses us of plying the actors with intoxicating liquor." "Oh!" murmured the wide-eyed star. "Oh! Well, you see, I didn't want her to think we faked our scenes. Come on back and I'll give you a drink," she suddenly exclaimed, turning toward the accuser. After considerable argument the woman returned and was presented with a glass of the sparkling beverage. She sipped hesitatingly, then with more boldness. "Why," said she, "it tastes like apple-cider." "Yes, that's what it is. Sparkling apple-juice," replied the chastened Olive. "Come back tomorrow and we'll give you some Burgundy strawberry pop or Cook's Imperial lemon phosphate." The lady departed satisfied, and as she passed out she remarked: "I think your star, Miss Thomas, is charming, so entertaining and interesting. She took me around and explained everything on the place." This ingratiating manner makes it possible for the young actress to accumulate her stock of information without arousing rebuke. No one--star, director, scenario-writer or property-man--is permitted to upset the discipline of the Triangle studio, where an efficient and smooth-running system of production has been recently perfected. So only during waits or off-duty hours does Olive receive instruction in the various phases of work. The single directorial effort was made on a day when regular work was impossible because of the weather, but she insists that she is always studying the methods of the directors with the intention of becoming a regular producer some time. A recent production required a dancing scene in which a large company of girls appeared. The director was on the point of calling in an instructor to drill the dancers, when the star volunteered her services. For several days she labored consistently with the coryphees until they had mastered the intricacies of the latest Broadway steps. In return for this assistance the director agreed to reveal some of the mysteries of his art, but only on condition that the star was willing to spend time at the studio after the work for the day had been completed. Was she willing? She certainly was. Golf, tea and motoring were forgotten while she went over the script of her next play, studying the author's descriptions of scene, setting and character, and endeavoring to originate the little "bits of business" that give the touch of reality and human interest to a photoplay. "That girl has a business woman's head," remarked the director after this course of study. "I believe she will be capable of directing some day, but tragedy will never be her line. She'd speed up Lady Macbeth and have her doing a fox-trot and a hand-spring. Olive is a joy-of-living optimist--but an intelligent one." Soon it became bruited around that Olive possessed brains--that she had been actually caught using them in several instances. Such scandalous rumor about a film player had to be stopped. I discovered the Thomas tornado teaching a crowd of girls a new dance that called for considerable athletic agility. As I approached, primed to question her, she ceased her dervish whirl, brushed back her hair and gasped. "Have you brains?" I asked her? "Brains?" she puffed; and then, with a mischievous smile, "What are brains?" "Brains. Brains are--brains are--" I stuttered, and then reached for my pocket dictionary. With considerable gusto I declaimed from Webster: "Brains: (a) in vertebrate animals the large mass of nerve tissue enclosed in the shell or cranium, regarded as the seat of consciousness. It includes the cerebrum in front and above and the cerebellum below at the back. (b), In many invertebrates, a large ganglion more or less corresponding to the brain of the vertebrate." I paused and regarded the lady before me. "A vertebrate!" she muttered in awed manner. "You want to know if I am a vertebrate?" I nodded solemnly. "I don't know. I hope not," she replied. "But they call me 'most everything around here." Then with a flash of inspiration and a smile, she exclaimed: "The best way to find out whether I've got them is to ask somebody, isn't it? Do you think I ask too many question? Do you think it pays to learn something about pictures? Are all film actresses boobs? Maybe I'm getting my celluloid diploma too fast, eh? Think I have brains?" "I'm sure I don't know. You are almost too good-looking, Miss Thomas, to be so afflicted." "Is it an affliction? Don't good-looking people have them? Why don't they? Do just homely people have them? Have you--" I spun dizzily around on one heel, Chaplin fashion, and did a Keystone marathon through the studio gates. I have an awful hunch that the young lady with interrogation points dancing in both eyes is a super-vertebrate--a beauty with brains! But where did she get 'em? Why, in the business without brains!* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 1918 PHOTOPLAY [from a film review]...Olive Thomas is as sparkling as champagne...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 1918 PHOTOPLAY Under the Allied Draft Agreement, Jack Pickford, a Canadian by birth, has been drafted.

Her director had made the request that she shed a few saline drops over the prostrate form of William V. Mong, who in times away from the camera's stress, raises little piggies and geese, and Olive sobbed and sniffled and thought of all the saddest things in the world, but nary a teardrop would come. "Most times," she said, "I can cry to order, but now I think I'm cried out. First I was called East by my mother's illness, spent weeks with her at the hospital at Pittsburgh where she almost died, and then Jack"--this being Jack Pickford, her husband--"enlisted in the aviation corps and went to war, and--I'm afraid that these bigger things have blotted up the tears that once I could give to the screen." Whereupon her director, hearing the remark about Jack, took her to one side and began talking to her about what might happen to Jack in the war zone. He was still bound to have those tears. But he failed, even though Olive did faint at the railway station when she bade Jack good-bye. "I'm not afraid. Whatever happens, Jack's doing the thing I would want him to do. And I can be brave, too," she said.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * June 30, 1918 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Los Angeles--Olive Thomas, former "Follies" beauty, who now is one of Triangle's best bets, is driving a handsome new sixteen-valve roadster painted a canary yellow. Miss Thomas purchased the car for her sailor-boy husband, Jack Pickford, but grew tired of waiting for him to arrive from New York for a furlough and is using it herself while her coupe is being overhauled and painted.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * October 1918 Delight Evans PHOTOPLAY [from an interview with Olive Thomas in Chicago]...She's too matter-of- fact even to try to impress you. She told me she hoped to have some real parts to play; something more than simp ingenues. "I might just as well go back on the stage, if they won't give me bigger things to do in the movies. It's all work-work-work out in California; and one likes to feel one's done something to show for it." She showed me some stills for her new picture; she was taking them with her--"to show Jack, in N.Y." "Toton" is seven reels, and Olive plays a boy in some of it. "This is the first real thing I've ever done, I think. I hope they'll like it. I want them to take my work in it seriously, critically--" Yes, she's the same Olive who was in the Follies, where every girl knows that she may fill her role indifferently, but not her stockings. Olive, you see, is making pictures to show 'em that she can act, too. "At least," she concluded, "it gives me a chance to show what I can do; maybe that won't be much, but I can try."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 8, 1918 LOS ANGELES TIMES Bringing with her her own radiant smile, looking prettier than ever, and fetching along pleasant memories of a joyous reunion with friend husband Jack Pickford, and a nice new outfit of fall gowns, Olive Thomas, Triangle star, arrived home from New York day before yesterday and is preparing to go to work once more. "Yes, I had a lovely time," said Miss Thomas, "and the best of it is Jack is coming West after a while--we don't know just when, but he's quite certain to pay us a visit in the near future." "Did you find the styles changed any?" "Well, I don't know. You see, Jack and I were so busy--" "And how did the Broadway shows seem to you?" "Well, yes, the shows were nice. You just ought to see Jack in his uniform! He's just too--" "Did you meet any submarines?" "Well, maybe. But it was nice to find Jack in such wonderful health and spirits." "I suppose the styles are all military?" "Oh, my, yes, and I have just the cutest motoring cap--just like Jack's!"* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 18, 1918 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Los Angeles--We sincerely regret our inability to publish at this time Olive Thomas's appreciation of this glorious State called "My California."

Just before leaving for her vacation in New York, her new roadster figured in a collision in which it came off second best, and, as her coupe was being overhauled, the dainty little screen favorite was forced to resort to the hard-riding taxi. The other day Miss Thomas and a friend were motoring to the home of Julian Eltinge for tea. Eltinge lives in a castle on top of one of the picturesque Hollywood hills and in making the steep climb the Triangle star lost control of her car, crashing into a stone wall. The machine is now in the "hospital," although Olive and her companion escaped injury. Now Miss Thomas is riding to the studio in a--fliver.

It was Myron Selznick who corralled the young lady and made her the first star of the Selznick Pictures Company. Several other companies, we hear, had their eye on Miss Thomas, but it was finally Myron who made her believe she had the best chance for fame and fortune by joining his company. He is now "dickering" with several theatrical managers in the hope that he can get a suitable vehicle for Miss Thomas. She wants a play which has had a success on the stage. While no definite plans have been made, young Mr. Selznick expects to produce on the Coast. Miss Thomas is hoping, at any rate, such will be his determination, since her husband, Jack Pickford, is already at work there. It would be, indeed, an unkind trick of fate if she were detained in the East now, for all last Summer and Spring, while she was working in the Triangle studios in the West, her husband was busy in the navy here in New York.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 11, 1919 LOS ANGELES HERALD Charles Giblyn, the director, has arrived to direct Olive Thomas, who gets in tomorrow.

"I am a good judge of ginghams to this day," she said. "No one can put anything over on me in that line." Indeed, you get the impression that any one who tries to put anything over on her in any line is in for defeat. "My ideal of those days," she went on, "was Miss Milligan, the head of the ginghams. She was small and cute, and to be like her some day was the top hope of my childhood!" Her first great adventure was a visit to relatives in New York City. There was bitter mixed with the sweet, for she set forth thrilled with dreams of the joys she was going to have in the city, only to arrive when it was in the grip of the worst blizzard of several winters. For days that seemed months to her she was snowed in her aunt's home. When she did get out, she made up her mind to stay in New York. "It gripped me as it has gripped its other millions," she said. She found something to do. "It was not long before I began posing for photographic art studies and later for artists. It was wonderful pay for me--fifty cents an hour." She has posed for Harrison Fisher ("you can say I ADORE him," teasingly), Penrhyn Stanlaws, Haskell Coffin and other famous painters. "How," I asked, "did you get started with Ziegfeld?" "I just went up there and asked for a job," she answered. "No letters of introduction or anything?" "No; I just went up and asked for a job and got it. I didn't do much at first--just posed around, standing in boxes and frames while some one sang songs at me. "Do you know Jim Buck?" she asked, suddenly. I said I didn't, and a moment later regretted that I didn't. She said he was as nice as any one could be. "He gave me my first big laugh while with Ziegfeld. After I was engaged I was told to get practice clothes. I had no idea what practice clothes were, but one of the girls told me that a middy and a pair of bloomers would do. I already had bloomers--the kind they were wearing with a type of dress. Mine ran down to my ankles and ended in a ruffle. I put them on and wore them for several days. "One day Jim Buck came to me and said, 'Miss Thomas, I am going to ask you something. I do hope you won't be offended. It's about those bloomers that you wear. Are you bow-legged?'" "'No!' I answered. "'Then why on earth do you wear them?' he exclaimed. We've been afraid to order a costume for you.' "After that I got a regular gym suit." Olive Thomas has a mother, two brothers and a little sister. One of the brothers is about 25, the other not quite out of his teens. She is always busy planning the lives of those she loves. She wishes to help set up her eldest brother in an electrical shop in New York, and the youngest--well, he is just back from where he went with the U.S. marines. He enlisted the second day after we declared war against Germany and was with the fighting bunch in France who held back the Huns in their rush toward Paris. When he landed in New York, Olive was sick with influenza-pneumonia and had been taken from her hotel to a hospital. In a wild panic he hurried to her side. "I wanted to see you alive!" he said. "I knew they could never get you into a hospital unless you were near dead!" Miss Thomas sent the boy $1,000 recently as a starting capital for whatever he might want to do. It was sent through the bank, but there was some delay in transmission, which caused him great worry. He wrote to her and asked her to please try to trace it, for, he said, "I'd hate to lose all that money!" Just back from France and $30 per, there is nothing surprising in that anxiety. This incident in connection with her brother caused her to recall a "fan" letter she received soon after Jack Pickford entered the service. The newspapers had reported that she was going to New York to see her husband, and the letter came from a fan living in a little country town. Enclosed in it was $5, sent, as the writer explained, "Because I know you must be under very heavy expenses, with so much traveling and your husband in the service, and I don't think it right that you should have to spend all the money you so laboriously earn." "I appreciated that," she said, earnestly. "It reminded me of the time when $5 looked mighty big to me." There is nothing "up-stage" about Olive Thomas. She'll "kid" backward and forward with all comers. She delights in startling people and, especially, in shocking the dignified ones. Excess of dignity is as provocative to her as the red flag is to the bull, and she loves to take its possessors down all the pegs she can. Underneath all the kidding--no matter what she might say--there is a bubbling humanity, a freedom from sarcasm, that wins her way into the hearts of all... "I think," says Olive Thomas, "that you die when your time comes and not until then. I feel the same about other things as I do about death. I don't think you can change anything that is going to happen to you any more than you can change anything that has happened to you. That's why I never worry, and that is why I don't think people should get conceited and think themselves better than others." Her first meeting with Jack Pickford was at a dance in a beach cafe founded by the late Nat Goodwin. "Jack," she said, "is a beautiful dancer. He danced his way into my heart. We knew each other for eight months before our marriage, and most of that time we gave to dancing. We got along so well on the dance floor that we just naturally decided that we would be able to get along together for the remainder of our lives."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 1919 PHOTOPLAY Jack Pickford and his wife Olive Thomas with their respective companies are also inmates of the Brunton studio.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 11, 1919 Louella Parsons NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Just a Little Irish GirlThe little girl who lives at my house has a self-admitted crush on Olive Thomas. Rather condescending to all things of a motion picture nature, she came out of her indifference long enough to chatter for twenty minutes on the star whom she dubbed the best of them all, and to beg for a story. Being asked to do something easy and pleasant is so rare I astonished the small girl by promising to grant her request--hence the story. Olive Thomas came into town a few weeks ago with the Selznick Company. She has since I last saw her become the first Myron Selznick star and created for the screen the baby vamp role in "Upstairs and Down." Broadway has been blazing with electric signs with her name, magazines have been filled with her pictures and the papers have told all about Jack Pickford's wife who, refusing to bank on the Pickford name, went out for herself and signed a contract so alluring in its weekly demands, only a motion picture story could bring it to pass. And Olive Thomas might still be a little girl dancing on the Amsterdam roof in "Ziegfeld's Follies" every night for all the difference this contract makes to her. In the beginning I had to put her disposition to the acid test and she met the situation so splendidly, I am almost inclined to agree with the little girl who lives at my house on the Olive Thomas question. One broken engagement and another one an hour later, which I expected would bring an icicle reception, had no more effect on Miss Thomas than to say to my apologies: "Oh, that's all right; I am often late. I know you were busy." Later I commented on this and on how much I liked her way of being natural, without the temperamental camouflage so many actresses feel a necessity. "I am only a little Irish girl," she said. "Why should I try to pretend to the world I am something wonderful--when every one knows who I am and what I am?" The Pickfords have taken Olive Thomas to their hearts for just that quality. They are themselves wholesome real people, who dislike pretense of any sort. I remember Mrs. Pickford--Mother, as Olive calls her--talked at some length on the new daughter-in-law and gave me to understand she couldn't have done a better job if the had picked a wife for Jack herself. And they are in love with these two young people. The very first thing Olive told me was that she had talked to Jack the night before in Los Angeles and he would be in New York in about two weeks. "We have leased the Hitchcock place in 'Great Neck'--the Raymond Hitchcock house for the summer, and Jack is coming on to make pictures here so we can be together. There is a tea garden, and a private bathing beach and we are going to have just lots of parties there this summer!" Jack and Olive slipped over into New Jersey and were married without any of the family. Thomas Meighan who acted as chaperone and stood sponsor for the two youngsters was immediately dubbed "our illegitimate father" by Olive, who says she loves him for having helped her marry her Jack. "One of these days," Olive told me, looking at me out of her big blue eyes, "we are going to have a family. I love children. You know I have a little sister 5 years old, the most beautiful child you ever saw. I have teased mother to give her to us, but of course she won't. Little Harriet is my step-sister, but I love her to death. Little Mary Rupp, Lottie Pickford's child, too, is a darling, unspoiled despite all the affection and gifts lavished on her by the whole family. She and I had some pictures taken together--she calls me Aunt Tottle," explained Aunt Tottle, showing me with pride of photograph of herself and little Mary. While Olive Thomas's screen beauty is one of the things which has helped her win stardom, she isn't half as lovely in pictures as she is off the screen. She has light brown hair, with a golden glint. It reaches to her shoulder and falls in soft waves; then her eyes are the blue black eyes which only an Irish heritage can give. She wore--I promised the little girl at my house to put this in--a pink negligee, all soft crepe and lace, which brought out the pink in her cheeks. A saucy little dimple in her chin completed a picture Howard Chandler Christy or James Montgomery Flagg might have been glad to have sketched for a magazine cover. Usually when Dame Fortune comes a smiling and pours into the laps of one of her children everything which wealth can give she creates dissatisfaction, and horrid discontent. In the case of Olive Thomas, she has managed to avoid this error. Olive Thomas is as pleased over her blessings as a child. She makes no secret of her happiness, and her enthusiasm over the good things which have come her way. "Mrs. Selznick gave me a gorgeous hat," she said, "with two paradise plumes on--a lovely blue, so smart and good looking." And then we talked of clothes, and of all the pretty things young Mrs. Pickford has purchased for her summer wardrobe, such adorable blue frocks, the color of her eyes, and such dainty white and lavender dresses to wear when the hot days come. While we were chatting Blanche, who does Miss Thomas's nails and keeps her hair in good condition, came in to give a manicure. She had no more than started when a telephone call took her client into the next room. Thereupon Blanche, who is colored, launched into a description of Miss Thomas, her virtues, her beauty and why she would rather manicure and shampoo her than any other customer. "She'ss popular, too," said Blanche. "You ought to have been here Easter. This here room was a blooming garden. She had lillies, roses, orchids and that plant of azaleas was in bloom then--everybody likes her--" Blanche would have probably been talking yet if the door hadn't opened and a young man burst in calling loudly for Olive. At that particular moment Olive merged from the inner room and astonished me to the point of speechlessness by throwing herself in the youth's arms, kissing him and calling him darling. "My brother," she said, "destined to be the world's greatest cameraman. He has been in the marines and is out now and I am having him learn the motion picture business." Miss Thomas has brought her chauffeur and a new Locomobile all the way from California. Just now she is sticking to the California license. That is, until the chauffeur learns New York, she said. It may be cheaper if he gets in any difficulties. "Has he ever been in any difficulty?" I asked. "Well, once," she said. "I bought Jack a Stutz for a present--a surprise. I asked the chauffeur to have it all ready for my husband and he promised. I was leaving town. He had it ready all right. He took some girls out and smashed the car into bits." "Did you discharge him?" I asked. "Oh, I couldn't do that. You see he was sorry and the car was insured." Which is like Olive Thomas, who is the most human young person it has been my pleasure to meet in many a day, and I forgot to say Miss Thomas is just out of the hospital where she went to get rid of an attack of the "flu." She explained she was still a little wobbly and she thought she might die she felt so sick during the first days of the "flu." Brother and I watched Blanche manicure Miss Olive, and then I found I had stayed so long, I would have to hurry if I hoped to get my department written by night. That's the difficulty of conducting a column, it's always intruding when you are having a nice time. And I do like chatting with this little star who calls herself "just a little Irish girl" and instead of ranting over a picture of herself which came out very badly, smiles and says: "Here you have the only cross-eyed motion picture star in the world. I told Mr. Selznick I dared him to advertise me that way."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * October 1919 PHOTOPLAY [photo caption:] Olive Thomas makes a tea-party for her tiny step- sister, who came all the way from Pennsylvania to pay aunt Olive a mid-summer visit.

Perhaps you don't know that she has ever been unhappy. But we have her word for her brand-new exuberance. She admits her change of feeling. It's this way-- We found "Ollie" having fun with a pile of dresses which might have been the result of a raid on a misses boarding school. Middy blouses, tam-o- shanters and practical square-toed shoes perched brazenly on the top of a heap. A mackinaw coat of many colors struggled for expression from the bottom of the pile. "Ollie" was getting ready to go on "location." And now comes the reason for her happiness. Once again she is to be allowed to play the sort of role dearest to her heart--the role of a school girl. Ever since ever and ever so long ago when Olive played "Madcap Madge" for Triangle she has longed to do school-girl parts. She has pined for them. She has loathed herself as a debutante, disliked herself as a wife and mother, been disgusted with herself as a fisher-maid--in short never been satisfied with any of her celluloid selves since dear old "Madge." "I made the picture three years ago," she will tell you earnestly, "and fans have never stopped inquiring as to when I'm to play a school-girl again. My fan mail is large--exceedingly large--and the one picture remains the favorite. Fans haven't forgotten it even after three years, and now Mr. Selznick has agreed to let me shorten my skirts again, put a bow on my hair and romp to my heart's content." Our thoughts flew back to some of the dream "creations" we had seen Olive wear in recent photoplays, and we patiently endeavored to understand how she could look a Middy in the face and grow excited. You see we are feminine. Olive Thomas is not so much feminine as just a kid. "But I want to create a certain role," she explained. "You see Mary is the kid in pictures; Norma does drama; Constance is the flippant, flighty wife; Dorothy the hoyden; Nazimova is exotic and steeped in mystery, my Jack does boys, while I--I--why don't you see, I am just nothing at all!" She grew quite excited as she pursued the subject. "I have no fixed position. I don't mean a DEFINITE thing to anybody. Now you see if a fan wants to enjoy a comedy, he knows that he can pick Charles Ray, or Dorothy Gish and get what he's looking for. If a fan is looking for a picture of youth he knows that he can walk in to see Mary Pickford or my Jack and find it. For a frothy affair of sophisticated humor--there is "Conny" Talmadge. If it's drama that's wanted--well, drop in to see Norma. But how--I ask you--how can a fan know what he's getting when he pays his money to see me? He or she is likely to find me weeping through five reels because I haven't a child, or tripping the light fantastic as a chorus girl of questionable reputation. I grow to womanhood and am tossed back to the flapper type. I am nothing in particular. Don't you see? And she spread out her hands with such an expression of utter hopelessness that we laughed right out. And then she went on to tell us that she was to try her hand at school- girl roles again and if the public took to them she was to go on doing them for a while. She wants to create a sort of Booth Tarkington girl. She wants to be in the feminine line what "her Jack" is in a boyish way. She desires to be known as SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR. And her next picture is to be "Sixteen" and is an original story by Frances Marion. "My Jack did 'Seventeen' you know, and as I'm just a year younger than Jack it's alright for me to do 'Sixteen.' It's quite fitting, isn't it, that I should?" After we had exhausted our enthusiasm looking over the various styles of Middy blouses which Olive fancies, we stumbled across the apartment and into a motion picture machine. "I ran Charlie Chaplin off last night," said Ollie. "I have a lot of fun with it. I can get a new film every day. I just shoot it up there on the wall and entertain my friends." "Do you try out your new pictures?" we ventured. "Heavens, no" replied our hostess sitting perilously on the edge of a table and swinging her legs. "I hate my pictures. What's the use of pretending I like my pictures when I don't. When they show me one of my pictures up at the Selznick projection room I can't get a person to sit with me. I 'pan' myself so hard they refuse to listen. I think I'm awful." Now although you think Olive Thomas is all wrong and lacking in perception you can't help liking her for it. It is good for the soul to meet a person, especially an actress, and more especially a young, pretty actress, who fails to enthuse particularly about herself, and who just loves Dorothy Gish, and raves about Connie Talmadge, and thinks Norma is a dream. "Oh, sometimes I'm not so bad," she admits grudgingly, "but usually my face looks funny or my hair is not right or my tears look faked." She is delightful when she shows you her books of "stills." "This is a scene from my last picture. This pretty girl is Miss ------, Oh, she's lots of fun--such jolly company. And this was Mr. -------. He's an excellent actor. Been on the stage for eighteen years. And a charming person. This over here in the corner is my dog--isn't the location pretty?" Then with a flip of the head she turns the page and you discover she's been holding the book with her thumb smudged over her own portrait. She'd go through the entire book that way if you'd let her. Like Peter Pan we can't imagine that Olive Thomas will ever grow up. She impresses you as being a delightful child, playing at grown up but actually uncomprehending the responsibilities which go hand in hand with ankle dresses. She skips, not walks, and would probably turn a cart-wheel on the street if she felt like it. She embodies the spirit of youth and we can think of no one better suited to give youth to the screen than she. We hope she may be allowed to continue with her heart's desire and give us school- days. In these days when to look into the future is to imperil your disposition for the season, it will be decidedly pleasant to look into the past through "Ollie" Thomas and remember the good old days when times were a little less hectic, and you were young.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 1920 Faith Service MOTION PICTURE CLASSIC [from an interview with Olive Thomas]...Then, there is the matter of her looks--tawny-colored hair massed on her head, bright eyes, fresh coloring, a springy sort of a walk and rounded lines. No, there is no suggestion in Olive Thomas of "going out into the night" to find herself. She appears to be quite completely found, between the pictures and her new and fascinating occupation of decorating and buying for her new apartment and being Mrs. Jack Pickford, at which estate she is quite evidently pleased, save for the long distance and the long times that elapse between their meetings. Said Olive, with naivete, "I call Jack my 'long-distance lover.'" ...There is a certain directness about her despite her most palpable youth, which gives the impression of a small child in a mammoth toy shop, given, suddenly, carte blanche. ...The apartment, she told me, was to be well on its way to completion before the arrival of the "long-distance lover" for Christmas. It was going to be, she said, with anticipation, the best Christmas they have ever had. Their first was spent in Pittsburgh in the hospital with Olive's mother, who was very ill. Last Christmas Olive was here in the East in the hospital herself, with influenza, and quite alone, and so this third Christmas must do a great deal of atoning. Also, they have a kiddie with them. Six years old. Of the masculine gender. I inquired. The kiddie is Olive's brother's boy. Last summer the mother died and Olive adopted the small nephew. Just at present he is going to school in Tarrytown. At the date of my talk with Olive she was expecting him the following day to come to New York, while she bought for him a velvet suit and a fur overcoat. All told, the young Jack Pickfords were going to make a high and festive occasion of Yuletide. That very morning Olive had been buying Jack's gift, consisting of a set of black pearls for evening wear, at Tiffany's, and there was also a resplendent lounging robe of sumptuous silk, and then it was only the first part of December...Olive laughingly remarked that her mother says she and Jack spend all their salaries giving one another presents. "He's always sending me something and then I send him something back," Olive said. "You see, we have to bridge the distance in some way. At first I just couldn't get used to the idea of living this way, but I suppose one gets used to anything, given time. When we were together we used to use up the time fighting over things. I'd say, 'You were out with this person or that person,' and he'd come back at me in the same way, and we'd have a lively time of it, but we're over that now. We know that we can't sit home by the fireside ALL the time just because we cannot be together." ...As I was leaving she showed me through the whole of the apartment and told me, with the pretty pride of possession, of what she was doing, intended to do, with every nook and corner. One feature of her boudoir is to be an antique desk, lined--she is having it relined--with purple leather, and before which she will sit to write, Turk-wise, upon a mammoth cushion. All about there were pictures, framed in heavy silver, which "Jack gave me," of Jack himself, of Olive and of the kiddie, besides various other screen luminaries. I came away with the impression of a child playing, very successfully, at being grown up, and having a thoroughly good time in the playing.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 3, 1920 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Olive Thomas Mourning Loss of $5,000 BraceletThere is mourning in the house of Pickford-Thomas, the Pickford in the case being the ordinarily debonair Jack, and the Thomas being Olive Thomas, who, away from the screen, is Mrs. Jack, and neither of the parties will be comforted. That beautiful diamond and sapphire bracelet which Mrs. Jack so proudly displayed to her friends Christmas morning as a present from her spouse is gone, lost, strayed or stolen, and both declare they only wish it was a press agent loss. Instead of that, it is the real thing, and any one finding a little article of adornment, which cost $5,000 in good cash, or giving information which may result in its recovery to the Val O'Farrel Detective Agency can draw down a very substantial reward for his or her services. Mr. and Mrs. Pickford attended the Sixty Club dinner and party at the Ritz-Carlton on New Year's Eve, and just naturally Mrs. Pickford wore the new present. She knows it was on her arm when she arrived; she believes it was in place after she had been there for some time. After that all memory ceased, until, as the time came for her to go home, or when she was on her way home, she became conscious that it was gone. She has not the remotest idea when it disappeared, and, therefore can only hope that somebody found it who will prefer the reward to the possession of an article which will be thoroughly described for all pawnshops, jewelers and policemen.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 20, 1920 DRAMATIC MIRROR Olive Thomas and members of her company, with Director Alan Crosland and his assistant, William J.

Aside from the urge for a summer playtime, there are already two Thomas pictures reposing on the Selznick shelf waiting for their release dates. The youthful Selznick boss has told Miss Thomas it's all right to go to the "Follies," see "Honey Girl," "The Night Boat," "The Scandals of 1920," and all the rest of the shows she didn't see in the untheatrical West. Her husband, Jack Pickford, also has asked for a vacation or a transfer East to work in the Goldwyn studios here and he is expected some time next month.

September 6, 1920 NEW YORK HERALD (Paris Edition)American is Imprisoned for Smuggling CocaineAn American who gives his name as Spalding has been sentenced to three months' imprisonment for smuggling cocaine into Paris from Germany. The supply, which amounted to four kilogrammes, was concealed in a trunk which went astray and was sent to the depot for lost articles. Here, after several days, it was claimed by Spalding, who declared to the Customs' officers that it contained nothing of a dutiable nature, a statement which was disproved upon examination. In his defense, Spalding stated that the trunk had been consigned to him by a friend, one Mrs. Green, from Mainz.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 9, 1920 NEW YORK HERALD (Paris Edition)Movie Actress is Near Death by Poison DoseOlive Thomas, wife of Jack Pickford, the brother of Mary Pickford, America's "cinema queen" is at the point of death at the American Hospital at Neuilley-sur-Seine, as the result of accidental overdose of corrosive sublimate, taken in an effort to convince her husband of her affection. According to information obtained last night by a correspondent of the New York Herald, Miss Thomas attempted to take her life at the Hotel Ritz last Saturday night, after a dinner party in Montmarte with friends. Previous to her arrival in France, the Pickfords, as is well known in American theatrical circles, had numerous domestic difficulties. These were patched up and the couple decided to take a "second honeymoon" in Paris, which resulted in their meeting many friends well known in the "movie" world. On their arrival in Paris, "Jack and Olive" took an apartment at the Hotel Ritz. Early on Sunday morning, on their return from the dinner party gathering, something happened. Although details are lacking, it is understood that Olive, while her husband was peacefully slumbering in their apartment went to an adjoining room and drank a considerable portion of a poisonous preparation prescribed by a French physician "for external purposes only." The base of this preparation was mercuric, and produced the same effect as corrosive sublimate. French physicians were unable to alleviate the sufferings of the popular "movie" actress, and the services were requested of Dr. Joseph Choate, a personal friend and a practicing physician of Los Angeles, now residing at the Hotel de la Grand-Bretagne. The patient was immediately taken to the American Hospital at Neuilly, where she has been given the constant attention of the trained personnel of the organization. At a late hour last night the New York Herald was informed that Miss Thomas' condition was critical. Her husband, as well as Owen Moore, the divorced husband of Mary Pickford, have been daily visitors at the hospital and are expressing their deepest concern in the unfortunate occurrence which threatens to rob America of one of her foremost "movie" stars. French specialists were called into consultation last night and they are understood to have expressed the opinion that there is very slight hope of recovery.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 10, 1920 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Paris, Sept. 10--...Mrs. Clarence W. Wufelt of Los Angeles gave the following version to Universal Service: "Olive is my dearest friend. She had been feeling ill ever since her arrival here. Saturday night Jack tried to persuade her to stay in bed, but she insisted that, being unable to sleep, she wanted to dine out. We dined downtown and afterwards visited Montmarte restaurants, including the Abbaye Theielme. Among the others who were with us were Lieut. G. A. Ray of the American embassy and Fred Almey of Los Angeles. We returned to the Ritz at about 3:30 o'clock. Olive complained of fatigue and insomnia." At the embassy it was stated that Ray left one week ago, ostensibly to go to London for a vacation. Mr. Almey could not be found. According to Fred W. Nelson, he, Cyril Gray and Wilfred Graham, all of Los Angeles, joined the Pickford party at the Montmarte. "But," he added, "I can't tell you what happened though, because I don't remember a thing after 2 a.m."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 10, 1920 LOS ANGELES HERALD ...It was on Sunday [sic] night that Olive, accompanied by several of her friends, set out to "see real old Paris," went for the last time to the famous "Dead Rat" of the Montmarte district. All of them in the highest of spirits--on the surface at least--the hilarity at the Montmarte resort waxed greater and greater until, with the closing of the "Dead Rat" at 1 a.m., Olive Thomas and her crowd started on a taxicab round of the clandestine resorts which are always open to the magic sesame--gold. But even the most maddening of hilarious nights must pass with the dawn, and when the Follies dancer and star of the Los Angeles studios crept back into her suite at the Ritz at 4 a.m. she found her husband, Jack Pickford, deeply resentful. Extremely excited as a result of the round of Montmarte resorts a fit of deepest despondency seized her when her husband attempted to remonstrate with her. Olive went into the bathroom where she drank three-quarters of a bottle of bichloride solution prescribed for face external use. Whether she drank this intentionally or by mistake is a question as yet unanswered.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 11, 1920 NEW YORK HERALD (Paris Edition) Miss Olive Thomas (Mrs. Jack Pickford), the American "movie" star, died yesterday morning at the American Hospital at Neuilly-sur-Seine, after five days of terrible suffering, as the result of swallowing a large quantity of a medicinal preparation containing corrosive sublimate. Although much mystery surrounds the death, Mr. Jack Pickford, who was at the bedside when death came, denies that there was any attempt at suicide. Miss Thomas, he says, had been in a nervous condition for several months and merely took the overdose of mercuric solution by mistake. The actress was taken to the American Hospital early last Sunday morning, after first aid had been rendered by Dr. Joseph Lynn Choate, of Los Angeles, who is stopping at the Hotel de la Grand-Bretagne. He is a personal friend of the Pickford family, and was called to the Hotel Ritz, where he found Miss Thomas in a critical condition, a half-emptied bottle of poison telling its own story. Although Dr. H. H. Wanlen, acting chief physician at the American Hospital, remained in almost constant attendance, the condition of the artist gradually became worse until Thursday evening, when blindness developed, and her friends were advised that there was no hope for her recovery. Shortly after daybreak, yesterday, she fell into a peaceful sleep, from which she did not awaken. The return signed by the attending physician gives the cause of death as "acute inflammation of the kidneys," but it is understood that there is strong probability of an investigation by the French police authorities of the incidents which led to the fatal act.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 10, 1920 NEW YORK TIMES Paris, Sept. 10--The French police have begun a thorough investigation into the death of Olive Thomas, the American moving picture actress, who succumbed this morning to poison taken, it is said by mistake, several days ago... Investigation also is being made by the police of rumors of cocaine orgies, intermingled with champagne dinners which lasted into the early hours of the morning, that have been afloat in the American colony and among the habitues of the French cinema world during the last week. Tonight in the Sante Prison the police were closely questioned a man names Spalding, said to be a former American Army Captain, who was sentenced to six months in jail Monday for vending cocaine... Several of the Montmarte resorts which Miss Thomas visited on Saturday night were subjected to a close investigation today.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 11, 1920 Forbes W. Fairburn LOS ANGELES EXAMINER London, Sept. 10--Olive Thomas, broken-hearted and temporarily unbalanced, who died in the American hospital at Neuilly today from mercurial poisoning, was convinced that she could never again bring herself to live with her husband, Jack Pickford. Such is the story of the tragedy that came to London today in a letter to an intimate friend from a screen star on close terms with Pickford and his wife and who was in Paris the night Miss Thomas took the bichloride of mercury. According to the letter, the pair were enjoying an unbelievably happy "second honeymoon" when an interruption came. Jack made a hurried trip to London, August 25. When he rejoined his wife in Paris, Olive, the letter said, had told Jack that further life with him would be abhorrent and impossible. Then, the letter continued, came the wild party of Saturday night. The letter declares that Miss Thomas took a large does of cocaine immediately preceding the swallowing of the bichloride of mercury. (This is not borne out by the physician's statement.) She did not have medical attention until some time afterward. A friend of hers, who had spent some time in London with the pair, said "they were like a couple of kids, calling one another 'papa' and 'mamma.'" She said apparently their past quarrels had been forgotten.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 12, 1920 C. F. Bertelli LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Paris, Sept. 11--...Dr. Warden, famous poison specialist, who had charge of the case toward the end, declared a police investigation into the circumstances under which Miss Thomas died would be of the utmost value in revealing the facts. "It would show," he said, "whether Miss Thomas committed suicide, as the medical evidence indicates, or whether she took the stuff by mistake, as claimed. "Personally, I am convinced that if she had taken a sleep potion in the same quantity as she took the poison she would be dead just the same." ...Today Police Commissioner Catrou, assigned to examine into the circumstances under which Miss Thomas came to her death, returned a finding of accidental death... "Owing to Mrs. Pickford's dying without making a statement and also because of the fact that she was alone when she took the poison, the only possible verdict is accidental death by poisoning." Such was the summing up of M. Catrou as submitted to the higher officials. His inquiry dealt only with the causes of death, Jack Pickford, the physicians and Mrs. Florence W. Wufelt, who says she was Olive's best friend, being the only witnesses.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 13, 1920 NEW YORK HERALD (Paris Edition) An autopsy of the body of Miss Olive Thomas will be held at the Paris Morgue today by Dr. Paul, who has been commissioned by M. Pamart, the examining magistrate, to determine the cause of the film actress' death. While dismissing any suspicions of foul play, the police authorities wish to make a thorough investigation before permitting the remains to be sent to America for burial. It is said that the examination is being extended to certain Montmarte resorts and is linked with the case of Captain Spaulding, formerly of the United States Army, who was recently sentenced to a term of six months' imprisonment here for bringing cocaine into the country. The examination of the body at the American Hospital at Neuilly-sur- Seine revealed only the discolorations which are always produced in cases of mercurial poisoning. Mr. Jack Pickford, the husband of the dead actress, in replying to the questions put by M. Catrou, police commissioner for the Place Vendome district, denied reports of marital difficulties. His version of accidental poisoning and of the immediate efforts to summon aid for his wife was born out not only by the employees of the Hotel Ritz but by the physician who attended Miss Thomas at the hospital. During his wife's consciousness at the hospital, Mr. Pickford made an identical account of the incident, and Miss Thomas implied the accuracy of the account by the smile of confidence with which she regarded her husband.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 13, 1920 Forbes W. Fairbairn LOS ANGELES EXAMINER London, Sept. 12--Jack Pickford and Owen Moore arrived in London by airplane this afternoon from Paris for a few days. Pickford gave me the following interview regarding the death of his wife, Olive Thomas, who died Thursday from the effects of poison swallowed early Sunday morning, a week ago: "Olive and I were the greatest pals on earth. Her death is a ghastly mistake. We both canceled work in America to take a belated honeymoon. We were the happiest couple imaginable. Coming over she gave me a big birthday party aboard ship. When we arrived in Paris her only thought was that she had to buy some dresses and then get back home to complete her picture contracts so that we could settle down to have a home and babies. "I went to London to buy some clothes for myself and arrived back in Paris the fateful Saturday night. We had dinner with a few friends and went to the cafes. We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked airplane seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. "I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. It read: "'Mamma dear: Well and having a nice time. Leaving here September 11. I will cable you from the boat and will tell you all the news when I arrive. Olive.' "'Love to all.' "She was in the bathroom. Suddenly she shrieked: "'My God.' "I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me to find out what was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: "'Poison.' "It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. "She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' "I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive. "Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. "They told me she had swallowed bichoride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tabloids. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. "We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die. "She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. "She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. "'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. "But I knew she was dying. She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. "I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' "Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue. "I am leaving for home Saturday with Olive's body. Her burial will be in New York."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 14, 1920 NEW YORK HERALD (Paris Edition) Accidental death due to mercury poisoning was the result arrived at after the autopsy of the body of Miss Olive Thomas (Mrs. Jack Pickford) held at the Morgue in Paris yesterday in the presence of M.

No funeral service will be held in Paris, but the body will be taken to the Church of the Holy Trinity at three o'clock this afternoon to remain until Saturday, when it will be taken to America in the Mauretania, accompanied by Mr. Pickford and several close friends.

Sept. 9 Miss Thomas died at the American Hospital, Paris, after having taken bichloride of mercury. Denials were entered in Paris by Mr. Pickford and the friends of his wife of any suicidal motive on the part of the deceased. The couple were affable toward each other while on the trip over and often were in the company of fellow passengers, also known in pictures. The same group often met in London and Paris up to the time of Miss Thomas' death. Jack Pickford is 23; his wife was 26. Miss Thomas had been featured with several Ziegfeld productions as a handsome girl before deserting the stage for pictures. When leaving New York Miss Thomas was a Selznick picture star, reputed to be under contract to that picture maker at $3,000 weekly when working. Her type of picture that had proven the most successful is known as "the flapper" variety.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 17, 1920 VARIETY In Memory of Olive ThomasWords cannot express my sorrow, As I think back a few years ago When I worked on the roof with "Ollie," (As we called her) and loved her so-- Her generous ways in those good old days, Kind thoughts and good wishes for all, Will live in the memories of her pals As the "roof days" they recall.

In fact, I was invited to the party on the fatal night," Rosika Dolly, one of the famous dancing sisters, told me in discussing the death and the conditions in Paris which are held in part responsible for it. "I was not able to go and did not see Olive until afterward at the hospital. She was devoted to Jack and he was devoted. As she dragged out the agonizing hours before her death she kissed his hand repeatedly and told him how much she loved him. Personally I am certain that Olive could not have committed suicide while normal, and therefore I do not really believe she committed suicide."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 29, 1920 NEW YORK TIMES Women Faint at Olive Thomas RiteAmid scenes of great sorrow and such a crush of mourners that women fainted and men's hats were smashed, funeral services were held yesterday for Olive Thomas, wife of Jack Pickford, who died in Paris of mercury poisoning. The world of the stage and the screen in which she had been a much loved figure sent hundreds of representatives, many of them bearers of well-known names. There were besides hundreds and hundreds of floral tributes, ranging all the way from a bunch of roses, orchids and lilies sent by Mary Pickford to a wreath from the stage hands of the Selznick studios and including an enormous floral "60" from the 60 Club and a wreath inscribed, "Our Pal Ollie." The simple Episcopal funeral service was carried out at St. Thomas's, the Rev. Dr. Ernest Stirce officiating with the assistance of Bishop Darlington of Pittsburgh, a male choir singing appropriate hymns. There was a crush at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-Third Street by 10 o'clock in the morning, the hour set for the services and the interior of the church already was so jammed that it was found necessary to increase the number of policemen on duty from ten to twenty-five, while mounted men were called to force lanes through the throng that mourners might enter. A few minutes later, as the last notes of the choir's "I Need Thee Every Hour" died away and the organ pealed a funeral march, the casket, blanketed in purple orchids, topped by a spray of yellow and brown orchids from Jack Pickford was borne up the aisle. The pallbearers were Owen Moore, Gene Buck, Thomas Meighan, Harrison Fisher, Myron Selznick, Harry Carrington, William Kelton and Allen Crossland. Among those who followed were Jack Pickford and his mother, Mrs. Charlotte Pickford, Mrs. Van Kirk, mother of the dead screen star, and her husband, Harry Van Kirk; Lottie Pickford, Fred Almey, Jimmie and Willie Duffy, brothers of the late star; Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Selznick and their sons, Myron and David, Katherine McCarthy, Mabel Normand, Marguerite Cassidy, Helen Maxwell, Dudley Field Malone, Thomas Meighan, George Derr and William Semon. As the coffin was being carried from the church at the conclusion of the services, hundreds of those in the side aisles and the balcony came crowding for a closer view. Irving Berlin, William Collier, Jr., John O'Meara and other ushers tried to check them, but in vain. Before policemen could be called from the street the crowd had surged in among the pallbearers and was swirling about the coffin. Several close-pressed women fainted, men who struggled either to free themselves or to check the inrush of others had their hats broken and for a moment there was great excitement. Then big policemen came shouldering their way into the press, order was restored, the women who had succumbed were carried into the side aisles and the coffin was borne out. Eight automobiles took the family and immediate friends to Woodlawn cemetery, where the body was placed temporarily in a vault.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 6, 1921 VARIETY The sale of the effects and personal belongings of the late Olive Thomas Pickford, picture star, which were sold Nov. 22, 1920, realized $26,931 for the estate. Samuel Marx was the auctioneer. The sale was held at 115 West 32nd Street. Many theatrical celebrities were among the purchasers, a detailed list of which is published below: ...One 14-karet gold cigarette case, $50, Mabel Normand. ...One toilet set, 20 pieces, $1,425, Mabel Normand. ...One diamond pearl brooch and sapphire pin, $500, Mabel Normand. ...One platinum set with star sapphire, $425, Mabel Normand. ... [Mabel Normand was the only star listed. Some items were also purchased by producer Lewis Selznick.]* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 1921 Willis Goldbeck MOTION PICTURE MAGAZINE [from an interview with Mabel Normand]...She had some very beautiful portraits, photographs of Olive Thomas, on the table, carefully bound. She turned them over for me slowly. "Ollie never saw these," she said.***************************************************************************** Olive Thomas and Mabel NormandIt is understandable why Olive Thomas and Mabel Normand were friends. They both came from the same lower class Irish-American ethnic background, and they shared many of the same personality traits. But how close could their friendship have been--how often were they living in the same city during their film careers? Each of them went back and forth between New York and Los Angeles, and most of the time each was in the city where the other one wasn't. In April 1917 they were both in Los Angeles. In September-October 1918 they were both in New York. In January-March 1919 they were both in Los Angeles. In April-June 1920 they were both in Los Angeles. That seems to be all, except possibly for very brief vacations. So they were only in the same city from one to three months each year, for a total of about nine months--which does not appear to be sufficient time to develop a really deep friendship. Yet it is clear that some degree of friendship existed. The fact that Mabel Normand entered the Glen Springs Sanitarium shortly after Olive's death, suggests the possibility that Olive's death served as the impetus for Mabel to seek treatment for herself.***************************************************************************** It is tempting to speculate on what might have happened if the incident in Paris had never occurred--if Olive Thomas had not died. She then would have been the logical choice for such films as "Flaming Youth"--in which case, the 20s flapper might not have been modeled after the boyish figure of Colleen Moore, but rather after the well-rounded figure of Olive Thomas. The loss of Olive Thomas was not just a personal loss to those who knew her, it was a loss for the entire film industry.********************************************************************************************************************************************************** NOTES: [1] See WDT: DOSSIER, pp. 148-150.
