TAYLOROLOGY is a newsletter focusing on the life and death of William Desmond Taylor, a top Paramount film director in early Hollywood who was shot to death on February 1, 1922. His unsolved murder was one of Hollywood's major scandals. This newsletter will deal with: (a) The facts of Taylor's life; (b) The facts and rumors of Taylor's murder; (c) The impact of the Taylor murder on Hollywood and the nation; (d) Taylor's associates and the Hollywood silent film industry in which Taylor worked. Primary emphasis will be given toward reprinting, referencing and analyzing source material, and sifting it for accuracy.********************************************************************************************************************************************************** Ramona Miller has set up a web page on the Taylor murder at http://mailer.fsu.edu/~rkmiller/taylor.html**********************************************************************************************************************************************************The Photoplayers' ClubThe Photoplayers' Club was the first social organization of the motion picture industry in Southern California. It was founded in 1912, at about the same time that William Desmond Taylor began his movie career. Taylor became a very active member of the Photoplayers' Club and was elected an officer during 1914-1915, foreshadowing his three terms as president of the Motion Picture Directors' Association. Like the Screen Club in New York, the Photoplayers' Club was for men only, but at some special events (dances, etc.) female guests were permitted or tickets were sold to the general public. The Photoplayers' Club lasted less than three years, and had disbanded by mid-1915. Its demise was evidently due to mounting debts from their clubhouse. All of the items below, which trace the brief history of the Photoplayers' Club, were datelined at Los Angeles.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * December 21, 1912 MOVING PICTURE WORLDReel Club Formed at Los Angeles with More than Forty Charter MembersForty-three men, the majority of whose names are widely known throughout the motion picture world, signed the charter which was drafted at a meeting just held in this city when the Reel Club of Los Angeles was organized. The Los Angeles club is formed along lines almost identical with those of the Screen Club of New York. Membership is to be confined to persons connected with the producing branch of the business and to writers connected with publications devoted to the industry. The meeting, which was held in Brink's Cafe, was the outgrowth of a movement to form a California branch of the Screen Club, but sentiment seemed to favor a separate organization and led to the other name being adopted. Fred Mace called the meeting to order and was later chosen as temporary chairman with every prospect that his position as president will be made permanent. George H. Melford, director of the Kalem Glendale company, consented to act as temporary secretary and Charles Giblyn was authorized to take charge of the organization's funds until permanent officers are chosen. A committee appointed to take the necessary steps for a permanent organization, which includes obtaining articles of incorporation, consists of Mace, Melford, Frank E. ("Spectator") Woods, T. H. Nash, P. C. Hartigan, Frank Montgomery and Joseph DeGrasse. Before the meeting adjourned, C. A. ("Doc") Willat, treasurer of the New York Screen Club, was given an opportunity to make a speech. Only those who were enrolled at the first meeting will have the honor of being charter members. Additional names will have to go before a membership committee in the usual way. The full list of the charter members is as follows: Charles Avery, Russell Bassett, William Bertram, Al. E. Christie, Joseph DeGrasse, William C. Dowlan, Charles Edler, Frank Ford, Arthur Forde, Tom Fortune, Charles Giblyn, P. C. Hartigan, Harry Harvey, Dell Henderson, Thomas Ince, Edgar Keller, Charles Kessel, Joseph King, David Kirkland, Harvey Lehrman, Edward Lyons, Donald W. Macdonald, Fred Mace, Arthur Mackley, Ray S. Manker, George H. Melford, Frank Montgomery, Lee Moran, Lee Morris, E. L. Morrow, W. Ray Myers, T. H. Nash, Harry Otto, Henry W. Otto, P. M. Powell, Mack Sennett, J. B. Sherry, Richard Stanton, R. T. Thornby, David Wall, Raymond B. West, William E. Wing, Frank E. Woods.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * December 21, 1912 MOTOGRAPHY Reel Club Forms in Los AngelesThe Reel Club is the latest development on the social horizon of things motion picturesque. It was ushered into existence by forty boosters of the picture world of Los Angeles and vicinity and at the acclaim of the original forty, more than one hundred directors, producers and players celebrated the club's second meeting and declared themselves Reel brothers. The chairman of the Reelers is Fred Mace. George Melrose was declared secretary and Charles Giblyn treasurer. Ten dollars was decided upon as an appropriate sum for the purchasing of a membership, one-half of that being payable upon application. Chairman Mace appointed A. L. Christie, Frank Montgomery and W. E. Wing a committee on constitution and by-laws, the committee being authorized to employ an attorney to draft necessary papers for making application to the secretary of state for a charter. ...Those who added their names to the list at the second meeting and who also become charter members are: Eugene H. Allen, Nick Cogley, Walter Wright, John E. Brennan, Marshell Milan [sic], Sherman Bambridge, P. H. Level, W. H. Gillis, Ford Sterling, Charles Bartlett, Charles E. Basley, W. H. Ryno, H. A. Lockwood, A. M. Kennedy, A. Brandt, C. L. Fuller, James L. McGee, L. D. Maloney, S. J. Edwards, Herbert Rawlinson, E. M. Langley, W. A. Carroll, Bob Leonard, George E. Gebhardt, Paul M. Santchi, Alvin Wyckoff, J. A. Crosby, Jack Obrien, Art Acord, Richard Garrick, Walter E. Stradling, L. D. Clawson, Rowland Sturgeon, Frank B. Shaw, Howard Davies, Milton H. Fahrney, Robert H. Grey, Lewis W. Short, Charles E. Inslee, Richard Willis, William Clifford, Roy Watson, Mack Sennett, Felix Modjeska, Al Ernest Garcia, Henry McCrae, Edwin August, Horace Davey, Otto Lederer, Lenard M. Smith, Charles Dodley, J. L. Leonard, True Boardman and George E. Stanley.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * December 28, 1912 MOVING PICTURE WORLD The newly organized Reel Club of Los Angeles, consisting of men engaged in the producing end of the motion picture industry in Southern California, has obtained a clubhouse. A lease has been signed whereby it takes possession jointly with the Gamut Club of the latter's building in South Hope Street. The Gamut Club is an organization of professional musicians. The name chosen on the spur of the moment for the new motion picture organization has not met with the approval of the members and in all probability it will be changed before the articles of incorporation, which are now being prepared, are filed with the Secretary of State. One objection to the name Reel Club is that it suggests an organization of fishermen. Negotiations are now in progress with the Screen Club in New York looking toward an affiliation of the Los Angeles organization with the New York organization.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 4, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD The Reel Club of Los Angeles, to Southern California what the Screen Club is to New York, now has 150 members, all of them men actively engaged in the producing end of the motion picture industry, and it still has a name which no one is satisfied with, because outsiders mistake it for an organization of fishermen. Naturally, most of the members wanted to call it the Screen Club of Los Angeles, but would not, of course, take that name without the consent of the New York organization. The Screen Club, when it was officially notified by telegraph that the California organization had been formed, sent on a letter, asking that the membership list of the new club be sent to New York City to be censored, and that $275 in the treasury be sent on also to apply on the dues of $6 a year which the Southern California members will be expected to pay. The letter from the East was read at a meeting of the club, and from the way most of the members acted, an outsider might have supposed they were very happy about something. One of the motion picture producers who was present made an application for a copy of the letter, saying that he wanted to turn it over to the scenario editor of his company. "It would make a scream of a split reel comedy with very little re-writing," he said. Another man suggested that the request of the Screen Club be complied with, and that at the same time the Screen Club be requested to send on its membership list, so it can be censored at this end. "It's only a question of time before all the motion picture people in the United States will come here to locate," he said, "and of course, since they will be using our clubrooms, we will want to make sure they are all desirable." There was also a suggestion that the Screen Club be requested to send on $6 for each of its members, since turn about is but fair play. ...As a preliminary to incorporation the club, at its regular meeting December 14th, elected a full set of officers including 11 directors, who are to be known as the Board of Control, since the word "director" has a technical significance in the industry. As soon as the incorporation is perfected there will probably be another set of officers elected. Several of those who were named pleaded that they are too busy to serve, and only consented to act for the purpose of getting things started. The officers are: President, Fred Mace; secretary, George H. Melford; treasurer, Charles Giblyn; directors, Russell Bassett, Charles Giblyn, Joseph DeGrass, P. C. Hartigan, Arthur Mackley, Frank E. Montgomery, Thomas S. Nash, P. M. Powell, J. Barney Sherry, William E. Wing and Frank E. Woods.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 11, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Reel Club Changes Its Name"The Photoplayers" is the permanent name which has been adopted for the club of motion picture people recently formed in this city, under the temporary name of the Reel Club. The new name was selected by a popular vote of the members at a regular meeting held the night of December 21st. Among the names which were balloted on but rejected were "Film Club," "Silent Drama League," "Photo Reel Club," "Cinema Club" and "The Photoplayers' Club." The members liked "The Photoplayers," but rejected the word "club" in connection with it.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 4, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY Reel Club Changes Its NameAbout one hundred members of the Los Angeles Reel Club (temporarily so named) met at the Gamut Club, on the evening of Saturday, December 21, and by a unanimous vote of those present, decided that the articles of incorporation, now being filed at Sacramento, should bear the name of the "Photo Players" and in the name of the club, a letter was mailed to the New York kindred club, the Screen Club, so advising and extending the hand of co- operation and affiliation. Another meeting was held Saturday evening, December 28, to decide upon the permanent leasing of a club house. Upon this occasion stars from the Lombardi Opera Company, the Great Raymond, and leading acts from the vaudeville theaters added to the joy of the affair. Among the plans will be a masked ball on or about February 14, and somewhat later a double-header vaudeville performance by the club members, who, aided by the auxiliary talent of the actresses employed in the photoplay industry of Southern California, will present a diversified array of histrionic ability.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 25, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Photoplayers to Give St. Valentine BallPlans for the St. Valentine's Ball to be given by the photoplayers on the night of February 14 have been perfected. The ball will be given in Shrine Auditorium, the largest dancing floor in Southern California, having a capacity of 6,000 persons. William E. Wing has been appointed "manager of the ball" and will devote his entire time to it between now and the big date. Nearly all of the local exhibitors have agreed to run stereopticon slides in their houses for a week before the event and advertising space has been contracted for in all the daily newspapers. Every member of the organization, which now comprises practically every motion picture actor, director and camera man in this locality, is to be required to be on hand with his white breasted clothes. The women of the various production companies have promised to help in every way in their power, so that there is a reasonable prospect that the industry will be well represented. As for the public; tickets are one dollar and everything else thrown in.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 1, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY Photoplayers' First Ball Ticket Brings $75The Photoplayers Club of Los Angeles is to dance, on St. Valentine's night, at the Shrine Auditorium. The first ticket to the club's first ball brought seventy-five dollars, David Wall securing the ticket and the honor its possession entails. There was sharp rivalry for the purchase of the ticket by Frank Montgomery, James Young Deer and Mr. Wall, the two latter each bidding the purchase price and Mr. Young Deer losing out on account of his not yet having signed a membership blank. Before his extended fee of five dollars could change hands, Mr. Wall was declared owner of the disputed ticket. W. E. Wing is chairman of the entertainment committee and other committees were appointed by President Mace.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 3, 1913 LOS ANGELES TIMES The Photoplayers' benefit ball, which is to take place on the evening of February 14, at the Shrine Auditorium, promises to be one of the greatest social events of the entire season. Practically all arrangements for this gigantic dancing party have been completed by the committee in charge; and judging from the sale of tickets reported by members of the profession, it will be better attended than any benefit ball ever held in this city. It has been definitely decided that the ball will be strictly a formal affair. No costumes are to be worn by either the motion picture artists or the guests. Only those dressed in the conventional attire are to be allowed on the ball-room floor. The reason given by the members of the committee for this arrangement is so that it will give the guests an opportunity to meet the photoplayers as they appear in private life rather than in the parts they play for production on the canvas. Saturday night [February 8], the picture players are to parade the streets of this city. This parade is expected to be one of the most novel ever seen in Los Angeles. Practically all the companies working in this section will be represented in the line of march. Wild animals, automobiles, Indians, cowboys and prize horses, are to be among the features of the column. Police protection has been granted and the official route is to be announced tomorrow. The Selig company will furnish the wild animal feature. "Big" Otto has been appointed marshal of this division and has had his big automobile decorated with a new coat of red paint especially for the occasion. "Toddles," the educated elephant, known to members of the film profession as the "King of Comedy," is to ride on a big motor truck with "Curley," his trainer. Lion "Duke," the "King of Tragedy," is to ride in his cage on a truck. Hobart Bosworth is to ride "Busy" his trained horse. Henry McRae and Miss Kathlyn Williams are to lead the automobiles of the company. The local Selig branch has fourteen machines and they are all to be in the parade Saturday night. The Universal, is to be well represented by cowboys and Indians. Four- year-old Mattie, leader of the juvenile colony at Universal City and his father, H. C. Mathews, are to ride horses. Indians and cowboys will also be in the column from the 101 Bison company. A large automobile fleet is to carry members of the Kalem company. Fred Mace in his big touring car is to lead the Keystone division. Miss Elenor Blevins is to ride in her own machine. According to C. L. Card, there will be more than 100 automobiles in the line, aside from the many other features offered by the different companies.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 4, 1913 LOS ANGELES TIMES The Los Angeles Photoplayers' Club now has a membership of 230 and is expected to pass the New York Screen Club in point of numbers within a very short time. This organization was born November 27, with a membership of forty-five. Fred Mace sent out fifty letters and forty-five film stars met at Brink's for a little informal supper. The plan was announced and all those present paid the sum of $5 into the treasury and became charter members of the Photoplayers' Club. Meetings have been held regularly each week since the organization.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 8, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD The Photoplayers is now a sure enough club. Following the arrival of the organization's charter from the Secretary of State, the members held their first formal election of officers the night of January 10 and chose Fred Mace, of the Keystone Company, president. Mace had been serving as temporary president and was entitled to the honor which was given him unanimously. That the club exists today is due more to his efforts than those of any other person. The other officers elected were Arthur Mackley, of the Essanay, and Joseph DeGrass, of the Pathe, first and second vice presidents respectively; George Melford, of the Kalem, secretary; William E. Wing, corresponding secretary, and Charles Giblyn, treasurer.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 15, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Seventeen seems to be the new magic membership number for The Photoplayers. At each of the last three meetings seventeen new members have been taken in. The total active membership is now very close to 250. The next meeting is certain to produce enough new members to put the club over the 250 mark. That a social organization of such proportions could be formed in about two months exclusively among men actively engaged in the production of motion pictures shows what an important producing center Los Angeles has grown to be. The members of the club held a special election at their last meeting to decide which of the many leading women of the Southern California companies should lead the grand march with President Fred Mace at the St. Valentine's ball in Shrine Auditorium the night of February 14. There were 22 nominations and Mabel Normand, of the Keystone company, won by a small margin.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 6, 1913 LOS ANGELES TIMES Fred Mace, founder and president of the Photoplayers, has at last announced the official route of the Photoplayers' parade, which is scheduled for Saturday night. The parade is to form at Tenth street and Grand avenue at 7 o'clock. The lime of the march is north on Grand to Eighth, east on Eighth to Broadway, north on Broadway to Second, east on Second to Spring, south on Spring to Ninth, east on Ninth to Main, north on Main to Temple and disband. An escort of mounted police is to lead the pageant. President Mace and Miss Mabel Normand are to head the parade in a decorated automobile. According to the Executive Committee, there will be more than 200 machines in line, carrying the managers and directors of the forty-four companies located here and members of their companies... Richard Garrick has been appointed chief marshal and Tom Santchez, vice- marshal... Tom Santchez, the husky sergeant-at-arms of the Photoplayers, has been instructed to muster a band of brother screen actors of equal husk for the heavy service at the Photoplayers' ball, which is to be held at the Shrine Auditorium, February 14. With this crew on the floor there is little chance of anything getting by.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 7, 1913 LOS ANGELES TIMES Henry McRae, the Selig director, has studded with electric lights the automobile in which he and Kathlyn Williams will ride in the Photoplayer's parade Saturday night. Not willing to be outdone, Fred Mace, president of The Photoplayers, has rigged lights both inside and outside of the car in which he and Miss Mabel Normand will lead the parade.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 14, 1913 LOS ANGELES TIMES Prominent photoplayers, representing practically all of the forty-five companies operating in Los Angeles, gathered at the Selig studios in Edendale last night to rehearse the grand march for the photoplayers' ball, which is to be held at the Shrine Auditorium this evening. Besides the rehearsal, a brief business meeting was held by officers and members of the Photoplayers. The tickets for the ball which were not sold, were turned in and an accounting took place. It was discovered that out of the 10,000 tickets issued there were 9856 sold. It was decided to sell tickets at the office of the Shrine Auditorium before the ball this evening, as many have become interested in the ball during the last two days and have not been able to secure their tickets. This promises to be the greatest ball ever held in Los Angeles. There will be a great many of those who have tickets who will not attend, but there should be at least 8000 people in the ballroom. According to members of the Executive Committee, 1800 couples may dance on the Shrine floor at one time with comfort. Naturally there will be a great many people at the ball as spectators, and these will in no way crowd the dancers, as there is a seating capacity for several thousand people in the building. The music is to be furnished by a band of twenty-two pieces ant there has been nothing left undone by those in charge of the affair, which would tend to add to the enjoyment of the guests.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 15, 1913 LOS ANGELES TIMES They Really Have Voices Photoplayers Meet Audience and Say "Hello" Their Inaugural Ball Very Largely Attended Ten Thousand Dollars for Clubhouse FundFriends of years standing heard one another speak for the first time last night at the photoplayers' inaugural ball in Shrine Auditorium. Actors in the motion pictures met and mingled with their audience and greatly enjoyed the experience. The audience long had wondered what the voices of their favorites sounded like, and how these men and women of a make-believe world really looked in the flesh. Curiosity in this direction was pleasantly gratified at this remarkably successful affair. Nearly 10,000 tickets were sold and more than half that number of persons attended the event. Even before the grand march virtually every seat was occupied. The scene was one of brilliant color. Beautiful women more familiar to the onlookers in the guise of western heroines, picturesquely attired in rough-and-ready garments known to the plains in pioneer days were there in gorgeous gowns of Parisian make, but they were recognized just the same. Devotees of the moving picture shows were as interested in picking their photo-drama friends from the merry throng as they would have been in witnessing their actions in the latest thrilling melodrama of the theater screen. A spirit of the utmost friendliness pervaded the atmosphere and the hosts and hostesses made it manifest that they were delighted to be in such close touch with the people who their principal purpose in life it is to entertain. The entertainment last night was in different form than they had ever before offered in Los Angeles, and it was all the more enjoyable on that account. Fred Mace, president of the Photoplayers' Club, and Miss Mabel Normand, leading lady of the Keystone Company, led the grand march, in which eighty- four couples, all prominent members of the local photoplay colony, participated. There were nearly 2000 motion picture actors and actresses in attendance, but only the leading men and women, the directors and the managers, appeared in the opening number. Elaborate gowns were very much in evidence. The twenty-four dances were cleverly marked on the programme. There was the "Mace meander" and then came the "studio stumble." The dramatic drag, silent slide, camera cavort, screen scoot, reel rave, foreground frolic, actors' amble, hospital hop, directors' dirge, switchback sway and pay-day prance, were some of the others. Los Angeles is the present home of forty-five moving picture companies and all of them were represented almost in their entirety. Besides the Southern California notables several photoplay persons of the East were in attendance. Among these were Dave Horsley, one of the owners of the Nestor Company, whose home is in New York; Charles O. Bauman of New York, president of the New York Motion Picture Company; E. A. Smith of New York, president of the Vitagraph Company; Samuel Long of New York, president of the Kalem Company; Charles Kessel of New York, general manager of the New York Motion Picture Company, and F. J. Balshofer, another official of this same company. The proceeds of the ball will be devoted to a fund being raised for the construction of a home for the Photoplayers' Club. The programme alone netted $3200, thanks to the heavy advertising patronage. The ticket sales amounted to nearly $10,000. Plans for the clubhouse are only tentative as yet, and its location has not been decided upon, but steps in this direction will be taken in the near future. All members of the club constituted the reception committee last night. Richard Garrick was floor manager, and members of the Board of Control were his assistants.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 1, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY How the Photoplayers Club Did It Their First BallThe Los Angeles Photoplayers' ball Valentine's night was a disappointingly fine affair, as the Los Angeles Examiner expressed it. One expected to see yelling "Injuns" and fat Dutchmen and cowboys and poor but beautiful girls, too. All this dream had to be discarded when one got a look at the ballroom scene in the big Shrine Auditorium, for it was very much like several brilliant predecessors. The men didn't dash in and say, "Halt!" or "Curses!"; no damsels were succored, of trustful females there were none; one did not glimpse any squalor or wretchedness. Nothing of all this happened. On the contrary this affair merged all of them into a uniform assemblage, the women in their kinemacolor clothes and the men with the open- face accoutrement--in other words, evening garb. The best known characters of the film world were there. There were comedy men, serious men, character men, juveniles; there were heroes and villains, kings and beggars, saints and thieves; then, of course, there were heroines and poor little shop girls and old maids and little country lassies; in fact, nothing missing. The cruel landlord who that very afternoon had driven the supplicating woman and her three weeping children out into the cold world for want of twenty-five cents for the rent was discovered in agreeable conversation with the same woman, whereas the children were trying the waxed floor for long distance effects in sliding. It was one of the biggest dancing crowds the auditorium every accommodated, perhaps the biggest, and none ever could have been more decorous. A few individuals somewhat inclined to levity had suggested that "ragging" might be desirable when things warmed up a bit. It is to be written very severely that there was no "ragging." A man with a megaphone mounted into the band stand and executed a decisive flank movement on all this kind of motive by announcing that any one who tried to "rag" would suffer the ignominy of ejection. The giddy waltz, two-step, etc., had to suffice. It is a noteworthy fact that Los Angeles can assemble more photoplayers than any other city in the country, also more noted ones. The forty-two companies operating in and around the city were all so numerously represented that everybody came but the livestock. Also most of them arrived in automobiles, which is a pretty good argument there were no Cinderallas or their male prototypes on hand. The venerable dean of moving picture actors is Charles, otherwise "Pop," Manley. He is 82. He could have been playing in pictures before the Civil War had they been invented then; however, he has been an actor longer than that. Naturally he takes the part of an old man, though he doesn't look so old. However, by dint of making up he gets the proper effect. Another of those who can't play juvenile parts any more is Russell Bassett, aged 66. His record is 45 years an actor. He is the funny old man when you see him on the screen. He is the humorous father or perhaps the fat farmer who was so surprised at seeing his dude son come home from college he tipped over the pail of milk, then got mad and kicked the cow, also the son. Among the throbbing throng was discoverable Charles Murray, formerly of Murray and Mack. Mr. Murray says he has played everything up to date but a lizard. He and Jack Dillon, another comedian, together played a horse, and got a big laugh for the stunt--a horse laugh, maybe. Murray says it's great to be in the photoplay game. He's gained eighteen pounds in the open air and sunshine, and his beautiful wife, who is well known on the stage, watches him do funny things and laughs so much she says she is getting fat. You couldn't help seeing those wonderful children, Matty and Early. Two guesses are required to know, from the names, which is the boy and which the girl. The only violation of the anti-rag rule emanated from the active minds and was transferred to the radio-active persons of Matty, the boy, and Early, the girl. After a moment, however, the girl gave the boy a biff and said she had had enough. So much for the decorousness of it. Arthur Mackley is a villain. But, let it be added, only when he's being wound up in the moving picture reel for delivery to all parts of the habitable globe. There isn't a place on the several continents where they have enough enterprise to get a moving picture show that Mr. Mackley hasn't caused many an emotion of rage and hate, but he always gets "come up with." He was one of the most benign and genial men at the ball. To forget Fred Mace, president of the Photoplayers' Club and one of the most popular of moving picture comedians, would be an omission as serious as Mace is funny. He led the grand march with Miss Mabel Normand, a leading woman. It was a beautiful, not to say gorgeous, grand march, but Mr. Mace did not try to be funny. Miss Mary Charleson recently made a great hit--she is said to be always making them--by doing a picture all by herself, just she and her hat. She didn't have the hat this night, but the famous moving picture referred to couldn't have been any more effective than the one she made. Besides the photoplayers the audience comprised between 2,000 and 3,000 friends and spectators, and not half of those who came to dance could find room on the floor at the same time. The proceeds of the ball constitute the foundation for a fund which will be used to build a clubhouse for the actors belonging to the Photoplayers'.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 17, 1913 LOS ANGELES TIMES Charles O. Bauman was the first life member of the Photoplayers to pay the fee of $100 into the treasury of the organization.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 1, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD ...In the same company [Powers] is "Pop" Manley, who will soon attain four-score and ten and who without any doubt is the oldest actor in the pictures. In consideration of his age, his standing and the esteem in which everyone connected with motion pictures holds him, The Photoplayers, by unanimous vote, at their last business meeting, elected him as the first honorary life member of the new organization.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 15, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD After three months of wanderings The Photoplayers have finally come to rest in a home of their own. Members of the board of control this week signed a lease for the three-story building at 349 South Hill Street, in the heart of the downtown business district. The club will occupy the two upper floors, the ground floor being occupied by a cafe. The building was erected for the use of the University Club and was occupied by that organization until its membership grew so large that it was compelled to seek more commodious quarters. However, there is room for a club of up to 500 members and The Photoplayers at the present time has a little less than 300, so the rooms will probably not be overcrowded for a year at least. No sooner had the lease been signed than a force of decorators was put at work redecorating the entire interior. The rooms will have practically every convenience common to men's clubs and will be one of the most comfortable in the city.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 22, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD With about $5,000 worth of new furniture and other equipment scattered about the building "The Photoplayers" formally opened their new clubrooms the night of March 8. The headquarters of the organization, which now has nearly 300 members, are located at 349 South Hill Street. On the first floor there is a library filled with bookcases, reading tables and comfortable chairs, a huge lounging room with a wide fireplace, settles, great deep club chairs and smoking stands, a Dutch stein room, a dining-room and a well equipped kitchen, in which there are accommodations for serving a banquet for between 300 and 400 persons, and a secretary's office. On the second floor there is a large billiard room, with two pool and two billiard tables, and seats around the walls, an English tap room, a dressing room, a large bathroom with showers, a committee room, two guests' chambers, a room for the steward and a storeroom. Every stick of furniture in the club was bought new, the walls were all decorated and they and the rugs, carpets draperies and hangings form a color scheme in which soft warm browns predominate.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * April 12, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD W. Christie Miller, the veteran character man of the Biograph company, has been elected an honorary life member of "The Photoplayers" Club. Next to "Pop" Manley, of the Powers company, who was also given the same honor, he is the oldest actor in the business. Russell Bassett, of the Nestor company, who is third on the list, has been promised an election as soon as he adopts more sedate manners.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 3, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Members of "The Photoplayers" Club entertained their women friends April 9, when the first "Ladies' Night" in the new club home was held. The rooms were filled with cut flowers, there was special music and refreshments and after the reception which occupied the early hours of the evening there was an informal dance lasting until midnight. About 200 women guests were entertained, many of them famous in the motion picture profession.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 17, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD The second public appearance of The Photoplayers will probably be made the first week in June, when the club will give a burlesque show in the Temple Auditorium in this city for three nights and a matinee. At a general meeting of the club held last Saturday night a committee was appointed to make the preliminary plans and report back to the club at a special meeting next Saturday night. At that time the members will decide whether the data as presented by the committee justifies the move. The committee will make a favorable report, and since the sentiment in the club is strongly in favor of the show it will probably be given. [No announcements indicated the show was actually given.]* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * June 7, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD After four futile efforts to adopt a new constitution and by-laws at a general meeting of the club members, the Photoplayers have decided to hold a two weeks' election to decide whether the new regulations shall be adopted or rejected. The constitution was proposed by the board of control at a regular meeting, but action was deferred until a larger attendance could be obtained. Three times thereafter meetings were held, but at each succeeding meeting the attendance shrank and the board of control was unwilling to have a matter of such importance acted upon unless the action could be taken as the general sentiment of the members. Accordingly it has now been decided to place a ballot box in the club rooms for a period of two weeks, during which most of the members will have an opportunity to express themselves.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * June 14, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY General Manager A. M. Kennedy, mayor-elect of University City, was given a warm welcome by his many friends at the Photoplayer's club on election night. Instead of "Hello, Kennedy," it was "Hello, Mayor."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * June 21, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Photoplayers' Beefsteak Dinner at Their Club in Los Angeles, May 31, 1913[On page 1232 there was a photograph of this dinner, with 63 members in attendance and identified in the photograph. Those in the photograph include Fred Mace, George Melford, Francis Ford, Dell Henderson, Carlyle Blackwell, Douglas Gerrard, Herbert Rawlinson, Eddie Lyons, Allan Dwan, Marshall Neilan, Wallace Reid.]* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * July 26, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD W. Hanson Durham, the scenario editor at the Western Vitagraph company--or, rather--companies, at Santa Monica, has returned to his desk at the studio after an absence of nearly three months. On March 8 he paid his first visit to the club rooms of The Photoplayers, and before he had been in the building five minutes he slipped on a steep staircase and fell down a flight of stairs. One of his knees was broken and for several weeks thereafter he performed his duties in a hospital room. To keep three active directors busy is no snap for a well man, but Durham managed to hold the job down without assistance during all the time he was incapacitated. The adoption of a new constitution and by-laws made it necessary for The Photoplayers to elect four additional members on the board of control, making fifteen in all. There were nine nominations for the places--Henry Otto, Jack O'Brien, Allan Dwan, J. E. LeSaint, Al Filson, George Gebhart, J. A. Crosby, Marshall Neilan and Wilbert Melville. Mr. Melville withdrew because he has plans which will require him to be absent from the city for some time and the balloting resulted in the election of Otto, Filson, Crosby and O'Brien.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 13, 1913 MOVING PICTURE WORLD In Benny Singer, the Photoplayers Club of Los Angeles possesses a live manager. He not only runs the club with efficiency, but keeps the good will of all its members. Mr. Singer is from New York, and was for a long time connected with the Palmer and Madison Theaters, while he was stage director for many of the Hoyt productions. He also had a long experience with club and hotel business, being either manager or head steward for hotels in New York, Buffalo, San Antonio, Texas, and Los Angeles. He ran the hotel at Redondo Beach among others. Mr. Singer firmly believes that the Photoplayers Club will be one of the foremost Bohemian clubs in the states, and it is surely heading that way. The latest innovation is a Saturday night beefsteak dinner--it is a popular one, too.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 20, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY Fred Mace had a great send off when he went East with little Bud Duncan and Harry Edwards to join the Thanhouser forces at New Rochelle. Mace is president of the Photoplayers' Club and a fine president, too--it will be hard to fill his shoes. By the way, the Photoplayers' Club is one of the finest in the West and the membership list is assuming large proportions.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * October 4, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY At the Wednesday dinner at the Photoplayers' Club, Los Angeles, the boys did a graceful thing when they sang the special song composed and written by Photoplayers McCoy and Brady into a phonographic record--said song being written about Fred Mace, the absent president. Later the boys filed past the record and said nice things to Fred. The records were perfect and have been shipped to Mace, and all are betting that he will spend most of his time in front of a gramophone. Fred is missed, all right.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * October 18, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY It was ladies' night at the Photoplayers' Club, Los Angeles, last Saturday night and the rooms were crowded. Visitors came from Santa Paula, San Diego and Santa Barbara. The program comprised of music and dancing. Everyone looks forward to ladies' night at the club. "Daddy" Charles Manley and his wife came to bid the photoplayers good-bye and were presented with some beautiful flowers. Daddy tried to make a speech, but broke down. This fine old actor, who is 83 years of age, is returning to his home in the East.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * October 18, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY At the Photoplayers' Club in Los Angeles recently, popular Allan Dwan took the chair and kept things going in capital style. Carl Laemmle was the guest of honor and before the evening was through he was a life member. He made a graceful speech and was enthusiastic over his reception and everything pertaining to the club. Robert Leonard delivered two poems, one in praise of Allan Dwan and the other welcoming Mr. Laemmle, both by Richard Willis, and Bob's reading was immense. The club is going forward with leaps and bounds both socially and financially.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * October 18, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY Carlyle Blackwell received a great send off at the Photoplayers' Club, Los Angeles, last Wednesday when he acted as toastmaster at the dinner. All the boys wished him the best of luck upon his comparative new venture for Mr. Blackwell will produce all his pictures at the old Essanay studios on the borders of Hollywood and will have his own company and produce his own plays under the Kalem brand.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * November 15, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY The Wednesday night dinners at the Photoplayers' Club in Los Angeles, have become an institution and additional service has to be provided all the time, every week sees its new toastmaster and witty, short speeches and general good fellowship enliven the proceedings. The club is going ahead by leaps and bounds.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * November 15, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY His numerous fellow members of the Photoplayers' organization of Los Angeles are delighted to hear that the wife of True Boardman, of the Western Essanay's players, has perpetuated herself, so to speak, in a small edition of herself which she presented to her husband recently. The Club sent True the official communication: "Congratulations and best wishes to the little angel who has come to bless your lives. I read the announcement to sixty Photoplayers who were gathered about the Fellowship dinner-table and there were rousing cheers of 'God bless the little darling!' A toast was proposed by Toastmaster Mackley and all present drank to your daughter's health and long life. Hy. W. Otto, Secretary, The Photoplayers." The Mackley referred to is Arthur Mackley who used to be one of Essanay's most popular players.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * November 22, 1913 NEW YORK CLIPPER At the Photoplayers' Club, a wealth of witty and interesting material can be gathered of interest to the public. The other evening in "swapping" experiences, Herbert Rawlinson, of the Bosworth, Inc., Company, who, relating how, at the age of fourteen, he ran away with a canvas circus show, touring the smaller towns. He had an awful experience, and after several lickings he escaped one night, and beat his way to Canada, fearful lest he be caught. Herbert always goes to see a circus erect its canvas now, and often sees them fold them too. It fascinates him.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * November 29, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY Last Saturday evening the Photoplayers' Club of Los Angeles, held its first boxing tourney and some excellent and exciting bouts were witnessed. The boxing nights promise to be very popular.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * December 13, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY The boxing nights at the Photoplayers' Club have become very popular. Last Saturday five good bouts and a wrestling match were staged. President Fred Mace is on his way back and there is general rejoicing. He is an all round good fellow.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * December 13, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY Dave Hartford made a capital toastmaster at the last Wednesday night dinner at the Photoplayers' Club, Los Angeles. He made a hit when he announced that Fred Mace would be the next toastmaster. The boys made considerable noise. Oh, yes, Fred is quite popular.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * December 27, 1913 MOTOGRAPHY Wednesday, November 26, was a memorable night at the Photoplayers' Club. In the first place it was the first birthday of the club and in the second place the Toastmaster was no other than the Club's president, Fred Mace, who returned to "his own" and everybody elses satisfaction. It was one great evening. Fire Chief Ely was the guest of honor and he gave a humorous speech in which he accused Herbert Rawlinson of trying to put three of his fireman out of business, in doing a dangerous stunt. Herbert loosened a block of wood which fell and injured a carpenter and just escaped the "really truly" firemen who held the net below. Rawlinson was called upon to defend himself and threatened to either make a speech or put the blame on the leading lady! Being chivalrous gentlemen, the club members sorrowfully accepted the speech. It was surely some night!* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 10, 1914 MOTOGRAPHY The Photoplayers' Club had one great big night recently, when Frank E. Montgomery, the popular Kalem director, was toastmaster and provided the entertainment. The entrance to the dining hall was a huge teepee and the walls of the hall were covered with costly Indian relics, whilst the table cloths were Indian blankets and on every plate was an Indian gift. During the dinner Mona Darkfeather, in full Indian costume, ran down the hall and sang an original song dedicated to the club. She was vociferously applauded. At a given signal, another teepee opened and out came eight Indians in full war paint and gave a dance which brought the diners to their feet. There was an Indian poem of welcome to "Monty," by Richard Willis, and the usual yarns and speeches interspersed with cabaret artists. It was a novel and costly entertainment and was much enjoyed by everybody present. The supper is still the talk of the town.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 24, 1914 MOTOGRAPHY At the Photoplayers' Club on Christmas eve the bachelors held high jinks and then there was a big Christmas tree full of appropriate presents for everybody. For instance, Dustin Farnum received a little tin sword "for use in future productions." Fred Mace took the chair and it was one big, joyous evening. Russell Bassett, known as "Pop" Bassett, the famous old actor with Al E. Christie's comedy company, was unanimously made a life member of the Photoplayers' Club at the last dinner.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 4, 1914 MOTOGRAPHY Great preparations are being made for the Photoplayers' Club second annual ball to be held at the Shrine Auditorium on Saint Valentine's night. A very beautiful souvenir book is being prepared. Several thousand tickets have been sold and the financial success of the ball is as assured as the social and artistic ends. [A copy of the souvenir book is in the Special Collections section of the UCLA library. Taylor has a full-page photograph in the book.]* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 15, 1914 LOS ANGELES EXAMINERMovie Stars Shine at BallSummed up in one word, the Photoplayers' ball last night was as follows: Clothes. Another might be added, to-wit: Pulchritude. It only costs a nickel to go to a picture show, but there were five blocks of automobiles around the Shrine Auditorium. These are a few leading observations. It was a gala event, in all respects scrumptious. However, the clothes scintillated upon all sides even more impressively than the automobiles shone outside. The latest thing were those pantalettes from Paris. They are so late, indeed, that you have to set your watch a little ahead. The girl who wore them had beautiful blond hair and blue eyes, and-- But, alas, she has disappeared in the crowd, lost in the well known mazes, etc., and here comes Miss Kathlyn Williams with a Worth creation creating admiration, the desire to emulate and various other poetic emotions. Miss Williams walks into lion's dens and like Daniel, she never gets bit. This is not because she isn't courageous. Unlike the ancient hero she gets her picture on the screen and is a great favorite. She didn't look like lions and tigers last night when she led the grand march with Fred Mace. No, very demure. Mace was the patron saint of the Photoplayers' Club. He brought seven pairs of white gloves, which were stuffed about him here and there, giving him some embonpoint. The reason for this equipment was his handshaking stunt and getting the gloves soiled. There were many jolly looking persons. Most of these were tragedians. Those sad looking persons you may have seen are the comedians. They were not losing any of their temperament; their sadness and their gladness, whichever they make the money with, was all pent up. None of it got spilled. What of the man who makes you roar by being kicked down the stairs into an ash barrel and coming up all sooty and sputtering? He was there. He was wearing a low front effect, a narrow isthmus of vest skirting the southern side of a broad sea of shirt. Innocent looking villains moved about; it was hard to hate them. You could almost forget some of those crimes they have committed. Cowboys who hang by a toe and an eyelash to a "rarin'" broncho while they pick the maiden from the edge of the cliff; they were plentiful, but proper. No guns on the hip. Even clothes and a ballroom transformed them. Oh, movies, what strenuosities are committed in thy name! Miss Margaret Loveridge, who has beautiful blonde hair and blue eyes, is going to remain a leading woman because she has conquered the demon fat it was whispered. The same may be said of Miss Betty Schade, who had to walk 1100 miles before the manager, sighting along the curve of her chin, said she would do for a leading woman. The famous line of Cassius's, "Let me have men about me that are fat," doesn't apply to women in the moving picture business unless it's for comedy. "Pop" Bassett came, of course. He is the Nestor of the game. He was there last year, but is several years younger now. Anna Little, the "Indian" girl of the reel life, is very un-Indian in real life--no war-whoops at all. Charlie Murray, they said, has a pair of green trousers which he expected to wear, but his courage failed him. His legs got to shaking and shied from the green. Laura Oakley, formerly sheriff of Universal City, did not fall in love last night--particularly, that is. She said she loved everybody. "Jim" McGee, with that famous earnest look of his, who is used to mingling with the wild animals out at Eastlake, was exceedingly unsavage. He doesn't have to have beasts of prey around him to be nice. Colonel Pryce, late of the insurrecto army, did not shoot anyone. Another milk-looking man with a history of sanguinary potentialities. Take them by and large, they were a wilderness, and when you see them in the pictures they are terrible or side-splitting, sad or poor, happy or rich--all things, in fact--but at a ball they are "just folks." C. De Vidal- Hundt managed the affair.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 21, 1914 MOTOGRAPHY The Photoplayers Club of Los Angeles held their second annual ball at the huge Shrine Auditorium on St. Valentine's night. It was a brilliant affair in every respect and benefited the Photoplayers artistically and financially. From the time the band struck the first stirring strains for the impressive grand march with its beautiful women and handsome men and the wonderful dresses to the time the last of the boys returned to the club to discuss the function by the rising sun, there was no hitch with the possible exception that the floor was uncomfortably crowded at times. It is no use giving a list of "those present" for everybody who was anybody "don't you know" graced the ball with his or her august presence. A souvenir ball album containing signed photographs of the stars was put up at auction and realized $500, being knocked down to Fred Balshofer.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * April 25, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD William D. Taylor, leading man, who left Vitagraph last week, was the eloquent toastmaster at the Wednesday night fellowship dinner of the [Photoplayers'] club. He told how the actors should bear in mind "fellowship" when at the club, and not to pair off and create cliques. His talk was heartily received.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 2, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD The Photoplayers' Club has been torn up for a week. Carpenters have been fixing the walls as the winter rains penetrated through the brick, and the dampness wrought damage with the tinted surfaces.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 16, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD One good diversion the photoplayers of this locality have is the good fellowship dinner on Wednesday evening when the elite of the studios fare forth to partake of a feast, and to enjoy a good smoke and chat. Last week the spread was that of a kingly kind. Max Asher was the mystifying toast general, and he carried off the honors with a comedy night of fun. Max is of German descent, and every member, in honor of the toaster's nativity, wore chin "viskers" and amputated derby hats. The gathering looked like a horseshoe table of a thousand twins. Everyone looked the same, and the thousand and three laughs that were made filled the diners with delight. Not satisfied with good jokes, musical numbers and other entertainment, the comical Asher borrowed a pair of tangoers who performed some wonderfully clever dances, to the great admiration of the assemblage.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * June 27, 1914 MOTOGRAPHY Charles Ray, the clever young lead with Kay Bee and Broncho forces, was toastmaster at the last Photoplay Club dinner, and a large attendance testified to his popularity. Ray has been playing leads ever since he has been in pictures, and is an athletic, clean and clever young actor. He makes a bully good dinner speech, too.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * July 4, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD A local "pink sheet" this week had a headline story about how the lady film players were going to desert the Photoplayer's club if the men did not appear on Ladies' nights in evening dress. The story went on to tell that Jack Dillon was beloved, because he was the only attender in the conventional costume. He denies the story emphatically. Informal have been these affairs, and informal they will be, say the men folks. The Photoplayer's club members are organizing a glee club and will soon make music at coming affairs. A large number of ex-singers and musicians have placed their names on the long list of "musically inclined" as the notice reads.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * July 11, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD At the Photoplayers' Club last week a delightful session was enjoyed by many members. They reveled in a good old smoker, beerfest, and a few boxing matches. Saturday evening last was ladies' night, and a great party it was.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 1, 1914 MOTION PICTURE NEWS The members of the Photoplayers, now numbering more than 450 in good standing, held a mass-meeting in the Little Theatre, Los Angeles, Sunday, July 19, for the reorganization of the club, and the adoption or rejection of several important by-laws.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 8, 1914 MOTOGRAPHY In reminiscing at the Los Angeles Photoplayers' Club one evening last week, Charles Ray, the Kay-Bee lead, was describing his feelings when Thomas Ince handed him his first contract. He says it is the first time that he ever felt at all important, but the feeling soon wore off when he showed it on the quiet to an old timer who squinted sideways at it and said "Huh! I've got a box full of them."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 15, 1914 MOTION PICTURE NEWS At the regular weekly meeting of the Photoplayers, Inc., an organization of actors and directors with a membership of more than 450, held Saturday evening, July 25, the directors announced they had received a cable from Fred Mace, now in Paris, resigning the presidency of the organization, and that Joseph De Grasse, director for the Universal, had been elected to fill the office for the remainder of the unexpired term. William T. Taylor [sic], director of the Balboa company, was selected as vice-president, and Bertram Bracken was named a director.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 9, 1914 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH For some time past, owing to the absence of Fred Mace in Europe, the Photoplayers' Club of Los Angeles has been without a resident head and owing to the calls of the beaches and hills during the Summer season the interest in the club sagged a lot and the members in good standing met in several "get together" conclaves with the result that interest has been revived and the club was never in a more prosperous condition than now. On the night of the twenty-ninth of July, a supper was given by the members who attended with their sweethearts and wives, an excellent repast in which a cabaret performance by members figured, followed by a dance. One hundred and forty sat down to the supper and the event was so successful that it will be repeated monthly. Joseph De Grasse is the present president of the club, William D. Taylor, the vice president, and Bert Bracken, the second vice president.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 15, 1914 MOTION PICTURE NEWS A Photoplayers gambol is to be the big attraction in Los Angeles within the next few weeks, according to plans made at the weekly meeting of the Photoplayers, Inc., Saturday evening, July 25, at their club rooms on Hill Street. At this regular meeting the idea was suggested and received with cheers on all sides. Rupert Julian, formerly of the Little Theatre here, and lead in several big successes of London theatres, who is now with the Universal at the Hollywood studio, was selected as chairman of a committee to make arrangements for the first annual frolic. Among the members of the Photoplayers are scores of former stage stars, and all present gladly promised to do their part. Charles Murray, of Murray and Mack, is with the Keystone Company, and was the first to respond to the call for assistance with a number for the program. ...The program will probably be staged in four or five weeks and the net receipts will go to the treasury of the organization...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 30, 1914 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Manager Sullivan has resigned from the Photoplayers' Club and every one regrets his going. The club has had a general shake-up and is settling down to better things. The Wednesday night suppers are still popular.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * September 20, 1914 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH The Photoplayers' Club is looking up and the supper last Wednesday was splendidly attended. Larry Peyton, recently returned from San Diego, was in the chair, and a capital programme was provided. The well-known actor, Howard Scott, was the guest of honor.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * October 11, 1914 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH We had a great supper at the Photoplayers' Club last Wednesday, although the pleasures were tinctured with some reserve, for it was virtually a good- bye dinner to Henry Walthall, who is leaving for the East. How we do hate to see him go, for Wally is one of the most lovable of fellows as well as being an accomplished motion picture actor. We made it very clear to him that he was leaving some good pals behind.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * October 24, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Local players were delighted this week with Otis Turner as toastmaster at the fellowship dinner of the Photoplayers.. The old-time director of Universal fame had a rapid fire of amusements for the many artists, and his evening was one of pleasure.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * October 24, 1914 MOTOGRAPHY The Photoplayers' Club of Los Angeles about sold out its tickets for their jamboree on October 30 and 31, which high-jinks consists of a two nights' vaudeville performance by famous people. Such names as Filson and Errol, Deeley and Wain, Theodore Roberts, Jess Dandy, Ford Sterling, Charles Murray, Hobard Bosworth, Charles Chaplin and Will Ritchie will be on the program.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * November 9, 1914 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH The Photoplayers held their first annual gambol at the Mason Friday and Saturday nights, and there was a collection of stars and near-stars, behind and before the footlights, that would have made the most blase press agent weep for joy. Everybody in filmland was there, and the lobby was a veritable florist shop, while eager men sought to buy candy, flowers and programmes from the host of leading ladies and ingenues that seemed nearly unable to supply the demand. Film heroes and heroines stepped from the portrait frames with a cordiality that gave the whole affair an informal touch and made it such a splendid success. Miss Laura Oakley, Chief of Police of Universal City, kept the enormous crowd moving in the already packed theatre. The audience was nearly as interesting as the show itself. It included Isadore Bernstein, Mayor of Universal City; Mabel Van Buren, Beatrice Van, Vera Sisson, Anna Little, Dorothy Davenport, Bessie Eyton, Edith Johnson, Elsie Greeson, Enid Markey, Leona Hutton, Stella Razeto, the Gish sisters, Cleo Madison, Grace Cunard, Mabel Normand, Carlyle Blackwell, Billy Stowell, George Periolot, Donald Crisp, Bobby Harron, William Clifford, Herbert Rawlinson, James Singleton, Wallace Reid, J. Warren Kerrigan, Harry Carter, Tom Mix, Sidney Smith, Cortenay Foote and D. W. Griffith. There were many others in evening dress making the rounds of the boxes greeting friends and admirers. Tom Wilson opened the song programme with original parodies that held the audience from the start. His appearance in blackface was a disappointment, as every one wanted to see him as he appeared on the screen. In excellent voice and with a choice collection of semi-classical songs, Myrtle Stedman of Bosworth, Inc., earned the plaudits of the audience. Then came Ben Deeley with his famous "Good Old Common Sense" song, and scored a hit. He was called to give an encore, and sang his latest popular success, "My Heart's Way Out in California," which he put over in a fashion that finally forced him to make a short speech, which was a gem in itself. "Discovered," a short sketch, featuring Kathlyn Williams and a group of Selig Players, was replete with tense situations, and the comedy climax surprised and delighted every one. Miss Williams was ably assisted by Guy Oliver, Wheeler Oakman, Charles Clary, and Jack McDonald. The act was superb, every one scored a personal success. Mr. Clary as the friend, and Mr. Oakman as the husband, were especially good, easily maintaining their reputations behind the footlights that they have gained before the camera. Max Asher with a patter act assisted by a pack of cards, showed a dexterity with the pasteboards that won him instant favor. In faultless evening clothes and grand opera voice, Wm. Worthington rendered operatic selections to good advantage. George Cohan's first sketch, with its laughable lines, was offered with great success by Filson & Errol, who gave it the first production, and from the way the house enjoyed it proved that it has not outgrown popularity. "The Tip on the Derby" was very good. After the intermission Ruth Roland, assisted by Harry McCoy at the piano, proceeded to stop the show, the audience not being satisfied till the supes brought the piano back and the pair sang another song. Miss Roland left nothing to be desired either in her singing or her gowns, and the patter of the act brought one continuous roar of laughter. Charley Murray, of Murray & Mack, offered a monologue up to his usual standard, and was given a big hand. "The Sheriff of the Shasta," that Theodore Roberts made famous, was offered with a cast that made the sketch far superior to its presentation in vaudeville. Mr. Roberts is always good and, as the sheriff, he was a delight. Miss Smythe, the only one of the original case, was equal to bearing the only female role of the piece, and her scenes with Mr. Roberts were in her usual inimitable manner. Murdock McQuarrie, as the jealous husband, and Hobart Bosworth, as the acrobat, played these parts as only such actors of sterling quality are able. Lydia Yeamans Titus, with songs and character studies, fully contributed to the enjoyment of the affair. The Oz Film Company presented Violet McMillan, Frank Moore and Fred Woodward. Miss McMillan has often been compared to a doll and, as she dances like a sprite, her success was always assured. Woodward and Moore were great, and "Hank" is a favorite wherever he goes. This trio presented one of the cleverest acts on the programme, while one of the best dancing teams in vaudeville closed a show that will be always be remembered and a credit to the photo-players.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * November 14, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD About the hottest place for neutral people who like to argue is the lounging room of the club. Players of all nationalities gather here and some hot talks are the result...William H. Reid [is] the genial manager of the Photoplayers Club...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * November 15, 1914 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH The Photoplayers' Club raised some $1,200 with their vaudeville performance recently, but this was not enough to cover the club's indebtedness. At a general meeting last Wednesday Isidore Bernstein suggested bonds in values of $10, $20 and $50 denominations, and in less than five minutes another $1,200 was raised by those present and today the club is free from debt with a new spirit at the back of it. The Photoplayers' Club is far too valuable to allow it to go by the board and the "buck up" was very necessary.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * November 22, 1914 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH The Photoplayers Club has taken on new life with a vengeance. Last Wednesday night the supper had a bumper attendance, and Carl Laemmle was among "those present." The members have raised bonds among themselves to the tune of over $2,000, and this, with the $1,200 raised by the vaudeville performance, has cleared the club of debt and placed it on a good footing again. Apart from this the right spirit has again been infused into the club, and its future is of the brightest. On Saturday a tango supper will be held, and the ladies have promised to be there in force. Good!* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * November 29, 1914 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Theodore Roberts was the chairman at the Photo-Players weekly supper, and there was a bumper attendance. Next week Fred Kley, of the Lasky studios, will be the chairman, and he is a mighty popular man in the colony. Big preparations are already being made regarding the annual ball to be held in February, and all the members are giving their services free of charge. The result can only be one way. The club is stronger today than ever before.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * November 22, 1914 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH At the weekly dinner at the Photoplayers' Club Fred Kley, the popular studio manager for the Lasky forces, was chairman and there was an overflowing house. William De Mille and Oscar Apfel were present and William made a witty and interesting speech--very much in favor of the picture game.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * November 22, 1914 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH The Photoplayers' Club has conferred the honor upon Mary Pickford and J. Warren Kerrigan of having their pictures upon the official programme of the annual dance. Although several people of the film world bid for the position it was decided that these two popular players should have the place. This ball will in all probability be one of the largest affairs that the club has ever attempted, and judging from the advance sale of tickets the auditorium will be taxed to its utmost capacity. There are more of the film folk in Los Angeles now than have ever been here before, and it is expected that the majority will attend and eclipse all previous occasions. As each celebrity enters the hall the name will be announced in order that the public may see how their favorites look in real life, and may compare them to their phantom selves. Special decorations, which have always made the affair a success, are to be more elaborate this year than ever before.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * December 5, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD ...the first steps in preparing for the annual photoplayers' ball, at the Shrine auditorium on February 14, were taken when a committee on arrangements, consisting of Isadore Bernstein, Theodore Roberts, Charles Fais and George Melford, was named.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * December 12, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Turkey Day was observed here this week with all the pomp and good feeling and with an air of good fellowship among the photoplayers of the colony...Many merry social parties marked the week, the most notable of which was the photoplayers' ball at Venice. J. Barney Sherry, our friend the Irish Prince, and Miss Mabel Normand, our queen of the movies, led the grand march. A following of picture players in full dress was on hand, as were a thousand actors and other movie people in costume and disguise. The night was one of mardi gras, and for the first time in the history of the land Thanksgiving eve was celebrated. The same night, Fred Kley, business manager of the Lasky studio, issued the toasts at the good fellowship dinner at the club. His party adjourned later to the Venice ball and took part in the grand march. One of the best dinners ever was this week's, a large number of members being present.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * December 26, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Allan Dwan was the popular toastmaster at the good fellowship dinner of the Photoplayers this week. He had as his guest Claude Golden, a clever card manipulator from the Orpheum who was on the bill last week. A goodly crowd of screen folk were present and the program was all that could be desired, Mr. Golden keeping the screen men in continuous laughter with his seemingly impossible card tricks.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 23, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Carlyle Blackwell was the delighting toastmaster at the weekly dinner at the Photoplayers. The Favorite Player was "there" with good entertainment and a good crowd turned out to hear him. Many old faces were seen at the club and the organization seems to be on the rise of late, and everyone is talking about the big ball for next month. It will be a sure enough eclipse of any ever previously held. The bulletin board here looks like a pepper tree, a combination of red and green, so many Season's Greetings telegrams have been received.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 30, 1915 MOTOGRAPHY At the last meeting of the Photoplayers Club of Los Angeles [held on January 9, 1915], Del Henderson was elected president, succeeding Fred Mace, who is now in the South. William D. Taylor was chosen first vice-president, Henry Walthall second vice-president and Wallace Reid secretary-treasurer. Otis Turner, Al W. Filson, Carlyle Blackwell, George Melford, J. C. Epping, Douglas Gerrard, David Kirkland, George Siegman and Fred Kley are the men who compose the new board of directors.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 30, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD With President Del Henderson at the heel, the Photoplayers' Wednesday night fellowship dinner joy wagon broke all speed and attendance records this week. It seemed as if the very hub had turned out in a body to attend the big event when the new president of the club took hold. Never had so many members been present, and a great time was had by all. Afterwards many more, who could not be accommodated at dinner, returned and a general get-acquainted session started. The evening was a joyous one, no business interfering with the merry affair, although most everyone expressed their interest in the coming ball in February.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 13, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Whether it is interest in the coming big 1915 ball, or whether it is just an added impetus from new companies coming west, or just a natural livening of things here, the Photoplayers' Club is a busy place. This week Henry Balboa Walthall was the master of ceremonies, and a crowd equal to the one of last week was present to hear him. Every kind of fun and entertainment was offered the screen men; old timers met and new friends were made, the evening being a record-breaker for floating attendance. Many man came up to the club while en route to the Static ball on the same evening. [The Static Club ball was held on January 10, 1915. The Static Club was the organization of cameramen which would eventually evolve into the American Society of Cinematographers.]* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 13, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Saturday evening members of the Photoplayers' Club enjoyed a Dutch dinner and entertainment at the Los Angeles Athletic Club as guests of the entertainment committee, of which Leo P. Bergin is chairman. He attended the fellowship dinner Wednesday evening and formally invited the boys to attend the get-acquainted affair. The film fellows reported a jolly good time.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 20, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD The Photoplayers' club has been put through a whirlwind and shaken up and cleaned up. A force of artificers are busily engaged in remodeling the second floor. The bar is being taken out and a library put in with a card room just off it. The bar goes to the main floor, where the grill and stein room will be kept open all the time. This merge was made only after being agitated for by Douglas Gerrard, a member of the board of control. Manager Frank Cavender succeeds William Reid. Business has increased so much that a bookkeeper has been added to the employee list.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 20, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Just a last word. Douglas Gerrard, in charge of the boxes for the coming Photoplayers' ball said that the whole fifty-six compartments had been sold; thus the outlook for the big affair shows that it will be a real world beater.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 6, 1915 MOTOGRAPHY It appeared as if every prominent star and player of California's famed motion picture colonies attended the grand ball of the Photoplayers' Club at Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, Saturday evening, Feb. 13. Miss Mary Pickford presided as the reigning star of the evening and led the grand march with Dell Henderson, president of the club. All matters of state, screens and pictures were forgotten for the evening. The stars and players had ceased to be. They simply acted natural, and were a magnificent showing of highly cultivated, talented men and women. Notable society leaders of Southern California and visitors from all parts of the world now sojourning in California were among those present, while dignitaries of the financial and commercial world, film magnates, producers, cinematographers, writers and representative newspaper men added to the cosmopolitan air of the gathering. Seated in the rear of the gaily decorated boxes occupied by the people of the "movies" were several thousand invited guests who participated in the dancing and social greetings of the ball, each meeting his or her favorite of the screen and interchanging confidences that bring warm-blood people into equal appreciation of each other. Promptly at 10 o'clock the megaphone announcer called the grand march and the real ball festivities began, with Miss Pickford and Mr. Henderson in the lead, responding to the strains of martial music by the orchestra. They were followed by William D. Taylor, first vice-president of the club, and Cleo Madison; Henry B. Walthall, second vice-president, and Ruth Roland; Wallace Reid, secretary and treasurer, and Dorothy Davenport; George Seigmann and Dorothy Gish; Carlyle Blackwell and Mabel Normand; Douglas Gerrard and Fay Tincher; Fred Kley and Blanche Sweet; Isadore Bernstein and Mrs. Bernstein; Jack Blystone and Victoria Forde; Charles Murray and Mrs. Murray; Max Jennett and Myrtle Gonzales; J.

Goodfellowship unbounded! That is what William D. Taylor, Carlyle Blackwell's director, gave the regular fellows at the dinner Wednesday evening. As a toastmaster "Bill" is a grand man, and the event will go down in club history as one of the big times of the season.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 27, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Ha, ha, hat! Wow! Lookout, fellers, here comes the band! And so it came to pass that another good time was written on the Photoplayers' history book, that of Roscoe Arbuckle, one oversized comedian from the Keystone. He was a toastmaster royal, and every member present pronounced the dinner a grand success.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * [A photograph taken at a meeting of the Photoplayers' Club can be seen in the April 10, 1915 issue of MOTOGRAPHY, page 576.]* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * April 24, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD ...[On March 24, 1915] the Photoplayers held their regular weekly fellowship dinner at their fine clubhouse in South Hill street. Eugene Pallette was director-in-chief, and he started the ball rolling with the first course of the excellent turkey dinner cooked in the kitchen of the club. President Dell Henderson and Vice-President William Taylor were on each side of the toastmaster. The event of the evening was the address by Al Jennings, the man with a past, who claimed the right to a future--and he proved his contention by winning it. It will be recalled that Mr. Jennings recently appeared before the camera in "Beating Back," the story of which was based on his own life. In his talk Mr. Jennings recounted some of the events of his career. He did not spare himself--neither did he spare others. There can be no gainsaying the fact that Al Jennings is a remarkable man. He is a speaker of power. He has keen wit, a delivery that is all the more impressive by its straightforwardness, its frankness and its direct appeal to the hearer's sense of justice. His voice is raised just so high as may reach the last auditor. It is well modulated. The former "lifer" is the antithesis of the bad man as we are taught by those fiction writers and stage producers to believe him. He is short of stature and even of temper. He is magnetic, a natural leader. Not a bit of the drama in the story he unfolded was lost on the players and directors who with rapt attention followed him-- from his birth in a fence corner in Virginia as his mother was fleeing from an invading army; how at fourteen years of age he was a fully grown man and knew no law but the blue barrel of a "forty-five." Mr. Jennings knows his Bible and uses its parables, and he knows, too, how most effectively to use them. The speaker was given an ovation when he finished. Others who were heard from in song or story or talk were Dick Cummings, Charles Mailes, Hirshall Mayall, Chet Withey, Harry Gribben, Al Filson, Dick Willis, John Sheehan, Elmer Redmond, Mr. Pallette, the father of the toastmaster; Jack Dillon and Eddie Dillon. The weekly dinner of the Photoplayers has been one of the features of the club since its organization.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * April 24, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Herbert Rawlinson, toastmaster last Wednesday night at the club, introduced "a man who is soon to become a groom." The man got up and said a few words and we recognized Allan Dwan, who is to be wedded to Miss Pauline Bush, formerly his leading lady at the Universal. Everyone wished the F. P. [Famous Players] director the best in the world, and here is another wish for eternal happiness.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 1, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD On Saturday night the Photoplayers, Inc., quietly passed away and is now in complete and resposeful oblivion. Everything belonging to the club has been put in storage. The closing of the promising club was made because of the failure of a majority of the members to pay their dues. Of late much money had been lost each week, and so it decided "to close while closing was good," i.e., to stop the bills and pay those due while there was money on the hand. Wednesday night Eddie Dillon was to have been toastmaster, so the good members decided to hold a dinner at a local cafe, and to talk over the affair. The dinner was more of a success than any held before. The officials say that the club ought to be reorganized within a month or so.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *[Although the Photoplayers Club was now officially dead, there were a few more social gatherings held by ex-members, and a few meager attempts at revival.] June 5, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD On the evening of Thursday, May 13, many of the men who were of the membership of the late Photoplayers' Club assembled at one of the downtown restaurants [Levy's Cafe] for dinner. The coming of the actors had been announced, and as a result there was a crush and a great many were turned away. Later there was an impromptu entertainment, at which Henry Walthall acted as master of ceremonies. Charles Chaplin led the orchestra for two numbers. The was laughter as he began, but very shortly it was discovered he really was leading; there was hearty applause for him. The other entertainers were Charles Murray, Truly Shattuck, Roscoe Arbuckle, Martha Golding, Porter Strong, Ruth Roland, Julian Eltinge, Victor Moore, Harry Gribon, Leo White and Polly Moran. It was a great night.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * July 10, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD ...It was on May thirteenth last that at the restaurant in question there was a stated gathering of photoplayers. For several days previously a card near the entrance had announced the coming event. Seven o'clock on the evening in question found two long tables in the center of the room. All other tables were filled or engaged, and a goodly number waited an opportunity to be accommodated. Many had taken the precaution to reserve places, anticipating the demand. Some of the prominent players and directors took their regular chairs. It was nearly 8 o'clock when the long table began to fill. There was handclapping for Henry Walthall, "the little Colonel," when he took his seat. Some of those seen about the room--and no attempt was made to compile a list--were Frank Bushman, just arrived in Los Angeles, delighted with the town and mighty glad to see a man from the east; Fred Balshofer, Raymond Hitchcock, Mack Sennett, Charles Arling, Hobart Henley, three weeks out from New York having been transferred by President Laemmle at his own request to the Western Universal from the Eastern; Travers Vale, Louise Vale, Franklin Ritchie, Lottie Pickford, and more than a hundred others... There were cheers when Mr. Walthall arrayed in his "little colonel" flowing tie, arose at the head of the tables, just under the orchestra platform. "I have the very great pleasure and the honor," he said in that fine voice of his, "to announce that our fellow artist and photoplayer, Charles Chaplin, will now lead the orchestra." Mr. Chaplin made humorous reference to the large sum one of the papers had announced as having been offered him. "You must know, of course, I have been working very hard today," he said. "I have taken a fall and hurt my elbow." The comedian removed his coat and immediately replaced it. He faced the musicians and shook at them a mane that would have done credit to the leader of the Royal Italian Band. Roars of laughter followed the gymnastic efforts of the little funmaker. Suddenly it dawned on the big party that what it had construed as comedy was as a matter of fact straight hard work. Chaplin really was leading; the musicians were with him to a fraction of a second. The body swayed, the masses of black hair flowed from side to side; the most temperamental of Latin bandmasters apparently had in his bag of tricks nothing Chaplin didn't expose. Stirring indeed was the execution of Sousa's "Stars and Stripes Forever"' and absorbingly interesting it was, too, to watch the serious, even stern, faces of the musicians. There was a hush as Chaplin's arms rested at the cutting of the last note; then came a roar of applause testifying the admiration of the comedian's confreres and of the general public as well. An encore followed. Then the situation changed from drama to comedy, and there were many laughs. "I am not going to introduce but to announce Truly Shattuck," said Mr. Walthall. The old-time player put her hands upon the toastmaster's face and the diners cheered. Then followed "Gone are the days," and nearly every one sang the chorus with Miss Shattuck. When there were calls for more the singer beckoned to Charles Murray, and Mr. Murray came forward. He is always at home in this house; frequently he has been known from his place at the table down front to assist the orchestra leader. The two sang in fine voice that which so often they have sung together on the stage--"Alma, where do you live?" Martha Golding gave a recitation in French patois and Roscoe Arbuckle told two stories. Harry Gribon sang, so, too, did Polly Moran. Leo White recited. Hal Williams sang "Tipperary." Tom Mix, who in the Rodeo had been jumped on by a horse and badly hurt, was called up so that the party could cheer him. Porter Strong in a dance with an Oriental touch made a lot of fun. Charlie Murray gave a recitation in blank verse; it was not a recitation, either; it was more of a speech. He told of the woes of a comic, he praised Charlie Chaplin and took off his hat to him. He spoke of Julian Eltinge and of the dear old Burbank days. He said there were many familiar faces out in front of him and that he could go down the line. For once Mr. Murray was serious, but he carried the party with him all the time. "Our distinguished guest, Julian Eltinge," announced Mr. Walthall, and the ensuing applause was hearty. "I am very grateful to be here," said the well-known impersonator. "I just came out on a little vacation. Now I am not going to apologize for my voice but for my throat." In the splendid singing of "The Crinoline Girl" that followed there seemed to be no occasion for apologizing for either. Mr. Eltinge got his full mead of hearty praise. Ruth Roland was given a reception that indicated in unmistakable manner the affection her fellow players bear her. She sang sweetly and simply "Wrap me in a bundle and take me home with you." The screen boys and girls would not let her go, so she sang "California and You," and the diners helped her with the chorus. This is a good place to say that Miss Roland is a California girl--a San Franciscan. Dell Henderson, the last president of the Photoplayers' Club, responded to the call of the toastmaster by giving a recitation--and doing it well. One of the hits of the night was Victor Moore. After an introductory talk Mr. Moore told the story of the Broadway newsboy--"Partners." None of the pathos of the poem was lost in its telling. The speaker did not have to raise his voice; absolute silence was provided for him, or rather the art of the actor and the heart appeal of the simple tale secured it for him. "Over three thousand miles from here there is a little girl to whom I always drink every night when I am away from home," said Mr. Moore, as he concluded the story of the "newsy." "I'd dearly like to have you join me in drinking tonight to the best of girls, the best of pals--my wife." Everybody joined Mr. Moore. It may have been due to the influence of the story and perhaps it may have been partly owing to appreciation of the fine sentiment behind the toast or even again it might have been in a measure due to the reversion of thoughts to homes and pals back East by many of the expatriates, but there were more dry glasses than there were dry eyes. And the foregoing is just a part of the story of one night among the photoplayers of the West Coast.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * June 12, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Thursday night of this week the old standpatters from the Photoplayers club gathered together for an evening of frivolity at a downtown cafe where they go to most of the time. Two weeks ago there was a lively time and it was eclipsed this week. Carlyle Blackwell was at the helm and the people he called on were the best in the business. Harry McCoy was the first filmer up, and he led out with the national song, leading the big orchestra. Rena Rogers was next, followed by Jerry Gerrard, Dick Smith, Myrtle Stedman, William Rock, Julian Eltinge, Ruth Roland, Raymond Hitchcock, who gave the evening the proper comedy climax. He produced a Keystone scene with Dell Henderson directing. The big director of course ordered a retake, much to the surprise and approval of the vast throng. Vast throng being a gathering of film admirers, who had heard of the dinner. The place was practically all reserved by outsiders, although many prominent canvas people were at side tables. Photoplayers only were allowed at the two long tables.********************************************************************************************************************************************************** Back issues of Taylorology are available from the gopher server at gopher.etext.org in the directory Zines/Taylorology; or on the Web at http://www.angelfire.com/az/Taylorology*****************************************************************************.
