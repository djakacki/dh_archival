Fragments from Taylor's Life November 27, 1920 Ray Davidson DRAMATIC MIRROR The growth and development of motion pictures have disclosed one outstanding fact--that the successful film director MUST know life. If dealing with one particular phase his knowledge of that angle should be perfect. And of course it stands to reason that the man of widest experience is best able to accurately reproduce the humanities of a story. How many times one hears, "I don't think the maker of that picture was ever inside of a mine" or "Certainly English society doesn't act like THAT!" and so on as various discrepancies are flashed on the screen. "To portray life--one must have lived it." Certainly this axiom proves especially true in the case of William D. Taylor, now a producer of special productions for Realart. Mr. Taylor has gained a very particular reputation for human photoplays, plays of real people acting in a real way under different circumstantces. He will be particularly remembered for HUCKLEBERRY FINN, TOM SAWYER, THE VARMINT, THE SOUL OF YOUTH, THE FURNACE and a score of other pictures, all of them remarkable for their reality. The reason is not far to seek. For certainly of all the present day producers Mr. Taylor stands foremost in the matter of life experiences. Successively Irish student, Kansas rancher, Klondike miner, construction engineer of large industrial projects, actor and director of film features, he has encompassed an unusual segment of human activity. Mr. Taylor was born on the country estate of his grandfather, near Mallows [sic] in County Cork, Ireland. His mother was an Irish gentlewoman, his father a Colonel of English troops. The elder wished his son to become an army officer and in preparation he was sent to Clifton College for preparatory work in engineering, then going to Germany and France for training in those countries. Always, however, he had been fond of the play and cherished ambitions to tread in the footsteps of Sir Henry Irving and others. His father frowned severely upon anything connected with the stage and discouraged these ambitions. Shortly after his eighteenth birthday the Young Taylor was in Manchester, England, when the famous Charles Hawtry was appearing in THE PRIVATE SECRETARY. The present film producer applied to Hawtrey, told him he had "lots of experience"--and was given a small part. Friends of the family saw him on the stage in London and called his father post-haste. The result was that the boy was banished to a farm at Harper, Kansas! This did not cure him, however, for after a year and a half farming he signed to play with Fanny Davenport, taking for three seasons the juveniles in such well-known old plays as LA TOSCA, GISMONDA, FEDORA, CLEOPATRA and JOAN OF ARC. Miss Davenport's death and the Klondike rush came simultaneously. Remembering he was a licensed engineer he went north, made and lost a fortune-
-and then returned to play with Sol Smith Russell, Castle Square (Boston) stock and in the leading roles of such famous old productions as MEN AND WOMEN, BUTTERFLIES, THE GIRL WITH THE GREEN EYES, SOWING THE WIND and MADAME SANS GENE. After this came another trip to the Klondike, a barnstorming engagement to the Orient with Harry Corson Clarke and on return he built a big paper mill at Swanson Bay, B.C. Shortly after this he entered motion pictures with the old Kay Bee, doing THE ICONOCLAST. Then came engagements with Ince and Vicagraph. Balboa gave him his first chance to direct. He made five pictures with them, then going to American for production of the famous old sixty-reel serial DIAMOND FROM THE SKY. By this time he had become a seasoned director, signing with the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation with whom he remained until his affiliation with Realart. Among the pictures he did for Famous were DAVY CROCKETT and PARSON OF PANAMINT, Dustin Farnum; PASQUALE, George Beban; REDEEMING LOVE, OUT OF THE WRECK, Kathlyn Williams; THE WORLD APART, Wallace Reid; JACK AND JILL; THE VARMINT, MILE A MINUTE KENDALL, Jack Pickford and Louise Huff; UP THE ROAD WITH SALLIE, Constance Talmadge; HOU COULD YOU JEAN?, JOHANNA ENLISTS, Mary Pickford. For Realart he has done ANNE OF GREEN GABLES, JUDY OF ROGUE'S HARBOR, NURSE MARJORIE and JENNY BE GOOD with Mary Miles Minter and in his own right, THE SOUL OF YOUTH, THE FURNACE and THE WITCHING HOUR. Mr. Taylor is very grateful that he has had a life of such unusual variety. "I find use every day for some phase of it," he tells his friends. "It is an invaluable possession to a man called upon to reproduce real life. A story can't be presented on the screen in a human, gripping manner unless the director has been actually in contact with the situations depicted. A director of limited human experience must sooner or later 'come a cropper'. It is a profession which demands the knowing of something about a great many people and things. "For instance--I never thought at the time that being marooned all one winter in the backwoods of Alaska would be one of the most valuable things that could have happened to me. It was a terrible period. I had only a train of sledge dogs for company. But it was being with these dogs so constantly that gave me a love for animals, an ability to handle them. It has been said that I have been exceptionally successful in the use of 'animal stuff' in pictures. If this is so--it is entirely do to the six months alone with the dogs. "Army life? My father was a military man and I served in the British army. Mining, fishing, hunting, construction of industrial projects? When such problems come up there is always a niche somewhere in my memory which has stored up the information wanted. "How would a man act if he were about to be killed by a crazy man--or in danger of death from any source? I can assuredly answer the first part of that question--and tell my players should such a situation arise in the stories I do. For while in the Klondike one time my cabin was entered by a man who calmly announced that he was going to kill me, quoting certain passages from the Bible as authority. I took down a Bible--showed him where his quotation was wrong--and he forgot all about the killing! "But that's only by way of illustration. Life isn't made up of such melodramatic incidents. Mostly it flows along smoothly with certain characteristics in youth, maturity and middle age. There are some features in life that are the same anywhere--others are different according to locality. I found a month's hunting and fishing trip along the Mississippi River invaluable in working out the character of 'Huckleberry Finn'--assuring its accuracy. For certainly the boy of the Big River has different pleasures than the boy of Massachusetts, say. "In the same manner the memory of fashionable London in my father's time helped immeasurably in making correct the English society scenes of THE FURNACE. "A man must know these things himself to get them right. All the technical directors in the world won't help if the man who is making the picture doesn't know LIFE as it really is." Again comes the original statement, "To portray life--one must have lived it." Certainly this has proven true of William D. Taylor, student, engineer, miner, farmer, actor and director of feature productions. Such variety in life is bound to be reflected in Mr. Taylor's productions. They will teem with real life and real people because he has lived life among real people. He has been through the tempestuous school of experience the slogan of which is "the survival of the fittest." Naturally he brings the fruit of his knowledge to his directorial tasks. And that is why one is very apt to see the absorbing, the natural, the life-like pervading his photoplays. Take THE FURNACE which is being shown in New York. It is a story purporting to show the trials and tribulations of people who enter the state of matrimony, some to be burnt beyond recognition, others to be purified by the scorching fire of successful adjustment to new and strange conditions. Mr. Taylor sought to get away from the conventional. He wanted to do a big theme in a big way. And he succeeded, because he was true to his purpose. He was conscientious to a fault in bringing out domestic detail, in fitting the action to the titles. And it has been this way with Mr. Taylor throughout his motion picture career. And his picturesque life has lent color to his productions that they would not otherwise have had. No details of life on the farm or in the mine, in college, on the stage are lacking in truthfulness in the films that he directs. He sees to that. The result is a picture in which the human quality is uppermost. And when photoplays reflect this human quality they are art. Trust William D. Taylor! He is a sincere and intelligent director. He believes in motion pictures. And motion pictures will be the greater because of him.

Suggested Reading For those interested in additional information about Taylor, particularly the famous murder which ended his life, the following sources may prove useful. Most published recaps of the murder are filled with errors and all information must be carefully sifted for accuracy. In addition to the sources listed below, many books have chapters on the Taylor murder (including HOLLYWOOD HEARTBREAK, TALES FROM THE HOLLYWOOD RAJ, ACTS OF MURDER, WHODUNIT?--HOLLYWOOD STYLE, HOLLYWOOD R.I.P., KILLERS UNKNOWN, TEN REAL MURDER MYSTERIES, CELEBRITY MURDERS, UNSOLVED MYSTERIES, etc.), but they are not listed below because they add nothing to the established literature, and are filled with the usual errors--the same can be said of the many discussions of the case in "crime encyclopedias." Of course the original news papers of the time are also very useful; in addition to the five Los Angeles papers of 1922 (TIMES, EXAMINER, RECORD, HERALD, EXPRESS) the CHICAGO AMERICAN must be seen for its ultra-sensational coverage.

 "The Humor of a Hollywood Murder" by Bruce Long

(This was originally intended to be a book published in hardcopy form, but efforts to find a publisher were unsuccessful. So it will be serialized within this newsletter.)

Foreword by Kevin Brownlow

No amount of money would have induced me to write an introduction to a book about the "humour" of the Taylor case. But Bruce Long tempted me with copies of exceptionally rare 1913 issues of Photoplay, and as the saying went in Hollywood in those days, the only way to cope with temptation is to give in to it. Few of Taylor's films survive, but I was very impressed with his 1920 production of "Soul of Youth," about juvenile delinquency, made with an almost Dikensian feel for the squalor and brutality of reform schools. But my interest in Taylor lies beyond his work. My friend Liam O'Leary once took a picture of the house in Cappoquin, Co Waterford where Taylor grew up. I showed it to my wife, Virginia, and she had to sit down. It was the same house in which she had grown up. His family, the Deane-Tanners, were Anglo-Irish landowners; it is perfectly accurate to call him "British" but it would be closer to the truth to call him Anglo-Irish. They were a special breed, dying out now, but worthy of a few volumes of their own. (My wife's brother, Molly Keane, has done sterling work in this regard, but she recalls the Deane-Tanners only vaguely from her youth, and feels there are dark deeds associated with them.) The Irish are the most humorous people imaginable, and had Taylor survived the shooting, he might have cracked some jokes about it. Somehow, the idea of the press finding humour in the event causes one less amusement than indignation. America's yellow press, particularly the tabloids owned by Hearst, were far worse than anything represented by Hollywood. How they got away with their repellent stories, gory photographs and sanctimonious hypocrisy, while women's clubs got steamed up about the charming love-making of silent films, is beyond me. On the other hand, this is the press of The Front Page era; you can imagine the tough reporters, their hats tilted back on their head, swigging their prohibition gin from hip flasks, their prose flushing as purple as their noses. This book is a fascinating comment on American society.

Introduction by Bruce Long

On the surface there was nothing whatsoever amusing about the unsolved cold-blooded murder of top Hollywood film director William Desmond Taylor on February 1, 1922. The single gunshot which punctured his left lung not only ended Taylor's life but also helped ruin the careers of two top female stars and fueled unprecedented public outcry against Hollywood. Most of the nation was not amused; Hollywood certainly was not. But as days passed and the many bizarre threads of the case came to light, more and more humorous commentary began to appear in the press. The Taylor case has been written about many times and has inspired three full-length books, but authors have generally ignored the humor inspired by the case. This series is a collection of that original humorous press material. The Hollywood film industry has come under verbal public attack at various times throughout its existence, but those attacks were never greater than in the month following Taylor's murder. The revelations accompanying the Taylor case prompted the disclosure of other sensational allegations against Hollywood, and national anti-Hollywood sentiment peaked at this time. Subsequently, Will Hays assumed control of the movie industry and was able to placate much of the anti-Hollywood sentiment. With the passage of time, public morality changed and people were no longer so outraged by the activities of the film colony. The humorous aspects of that anti-Hollywood sentiment falls within the scope of this series. A substantial part of this series contains "unintentional humor" which was intended to be taken very seriously, but which nevertheless may seem to be amusing from our current perspective. Some of the material has been edited, and some material has been arbitrarily assigned to one chapter instead of another because there is some overlapping of subject matter. A few stereotyped comments which are offensive today but were relatively commonplace in 1922 have been included for historical purposes. It should be kept in mind that the material presented in this series has been selected for humor, not for veracity. Incidents and characterizations should not be blindly accepted as fact. This volume contains very little factual information about the Taylor case, but a great deal of information about the social and cultural attitudes of the press, the public and Hollywood in the aftermath of Taylor's murder. It is hoped that this series, while presenting a substantial collection of source material useful to scholars, will also be entertaining and humorous by today's standards.

Prologue February 15, 1922 Alvaro Shoemaker SEATTLE UNION-RECORD We ought to be glad this thing happened down in Los Angeles--that is, glad that it happened in Los Angeles instead of Seattle. It was a "big" murder, as the news boys put it, and--like all big things--we need the distance to give us a proper perspective. We were just about to despair of the movies giving us any thrills other than those in the films themselves. Fatty Arbuckle gave us a good show--while it lasted. [51] But he has gone through his second trial, and it drew so poorly that District Attorney Brady threatens positively to withdraw it after one more performance. Things were slowing up badly. California was having a rotten winter. Tourists were leaving. And then-- Action! Action! William Desmond Taylor, world's greatest movie director, British army captain, art connoisseur, traveler, dilettante, divorcee, bon vivant, occultist, et cetera, et cetera, as well as sole proprietor of the finest, best appointed, most frequently visited and most generously occupied love nest in the city of Los Angeles--William Desmond Taylor, Love Avalanche of Alvarado, [52] is found dead! Once again Los Angeles triumphed over her ancient, jealous sister. San Francisco could claim the Arbuckle affair. It was small, sordid; did not offer the element of mystery; just a plain drunk, with a killing for a chaser. Bah! In Los Angeles a real he-man bit the dust--a sure-enough lady killer, with more handkerchiefs, gloves, powder puffs and pale-and-thin lingerie in his trophy list than an Arbuckle could ever hope to bag with all the seeming advantage of superior booze and top weight. And compare the women in the case. Fatty's list of "those present" might be the register of the Home for Dessicated, Debilitated and Flatfooted Hashers. Who remembers them? Fatty had to bait with booze for his moths in order to get them to circulate around the formless, only partly combustible hunk of tallow that was Arbuckle, in the hope that one at least might get drunk enough to fall in. Now look--if your eyes be not too dazzled--look, look at the lambent flame of Desmond Taylor. Mark that classy galaxy that moves in queenly strides around the central orb. Think you they are drawn and held by sordid things? Not so. S'love, s'love! The Arbuckle setting was one of corks, empties, cigarette butts and katzenjammers. [53] Taylor died surrounded by incense, code love notes, monogramed hankies and pink teddy-bears. [54] The sauce piquante of the Taylor affair would be a fetching dressing to pour over even the classiest of chicken served up on the silver screen.
