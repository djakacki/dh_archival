***************************************************************************** What is TAYLOROLOGY? TAYLOROLOGY is a newsletter focusing on the life and death of William Desmond Taylor, a top Paramount film director in early Hollywood who was shot to death on February 1, 1922. His unsolved murder was one of Hollywood's major scandals. This newsletter will deal with: (a) The facts of Taylor's life; (b) The facts and rumors of Taylor's murder; (c) The impact of the Taylor murder on Hollywood and the nation; (d) Taylor's associates and the Hollywood silent film industry in which Taylor worked. Primary emphasis will be given toward reprinting, referencing and analyzing source material, and sifting it for accuracy.
*****************************************************************************
***************************************************************************** The 2-hour episode of A&E's "City Confidential" series, titled "Old Hollywood: Silent Stars, Deadly Secrets," was broadcast on March 19, 2000, and included interviews with Sidney Kirkpatrick, Laurie Jacobson, Betty Lasky, Bruce Long, Charles Higham, Raul Moreno, Marc Wanamaker, Ellen Strain, Gloria Stuart, Jennifer Niven, Duncan St. James, and Johnny Grant. The program also included several fascinating clips from the 1914 film "The Kiss", with William Desmond Taylor and Margaret Gibson. Although fans of the Taylor case will find portions of the A&E program to be padded and unsatisfactory, those new to the case may find it to be an interesting introduction, and it will hopefully lead to more substantial documentary efforts. In any event, it is a much better and more accurate program than the 1998 "Mysteries & Scandals" episode broadcast on "E!" cable. The A&E video is available for $19.95 plus shipping at http://store.aetv.com (Search for Desmond Taylor.) On a scale of 1 to 10, we rate the A&E documentary with a 5. The episode of The History Channel's "Perfect Crimes?" series, which included a half-hour segment on "The Case of William Desmond Taylor," was broadcast on March 22, 2000, and included interviews with Laurie Jacobson, Bruce Long, Charles Higham, John Christin, A. C. Lyles, Betty Fussell, and Ray Long. Despite having only about 1/4 the length of the A&E program, this program was much more accurate and interesting, and included never-before- published photos of Sands, a few seconds of Taylor from "The Quakeress," a computerized animation of the bullet path, and Ray Long's discussion of Margaret Gibson. This program was the best documentary on the Taylor case we have yet seen, and on a scale of 1 to 10 we rate it with an 8. Unfortunately, the video is only available in the "Perfect Crimes" 4-tape set, available for $59.95 plus shipping, also at http://store.aetv.com (Search for Desmond Taylor.) A more detailed criticism of the A&E program appears below. (The History Channel program had only a few errors.)

Some Errors in A&E's "City Confidential"

Although the A&E documentary "Old Hollywood: Silent Stars, Deadly Secrets" avoided many common errors regarding the Taylor case and Hollywood history, it still had quite a few errors. The following are some of the errors we noticed:
1. It was stated that Cecil B. De Mille and Jesse Lasky brought the movie industry to Hollywood. But when they arrived in 1913 there were already several dozen film companies active in Southern California, and Universal already had a studio in Hollywood itself.
2. In the biographical portion devoted to Taylor's history, no mention was made of his wife and daughter.
3. It was stated that "Captain Alvarez" was the most popular film of
1914. Although it was indeed a popular and profitable film, there were many films in 1914 which were far more popular, including "The Spoilers," "Tess of the Storm Country," "A Fool There Was," "The Squaw Man," etc.
4. It was stated that Mabel Normand was under contract to Paramount. On the contrary, she never, ever worked for Paramount. At the time Paramount was formed, she was working for Sennett, and the only other film companies she worked for after that time were Goldwyn and Roach.
5. It was stated that Taylor was the head of a formal organization dedicated to fighting drug dealing in Hollywood. Although Taylor had met with a Federal drug agent in 1920 and discussed drug use in Hollywood, there are no contemporary reports that Taylor was head of any formal anti-drug organization. Taylor was head of the Motion Picture Director's Association and also head of an anti-censorship organization. But there was no formal anti-drug organization whatsoever in Hollywood at that time. All the rumors that Taylor was fighting drug gangs around the time of his death portrayed Taylor as fighting a lone battle against them--not as the leader of an anti- drug organization.
6. Edward Sands was described as a "fellow soldier," implying that Taylor and Sands were acquaintances from Taylor's army days. But Taylor had been in the British Army, and Sands had been in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army. Also, Sands was wanted for desertion under his real name of Edward Snyder, so he would have kept hidden his previous military service. He certainly did not "throw himself on Taylor's mercy" in order to get a job with Taylor.
7. It was stated that Arbuckle's fateful party was celebrating a new $3,000,000 contract he had signed with Paramount. No, Arbuckle's contract had been signed nine months earlier, in January 1921. This party was just a holiday party for the Labor Day weekend.
8. The report, that Wyoming cowboys had shot up a screen showing an Arbuckle film, was later proven to have been a fake publicity item which never had occurred. See Oderman's book on Arbuckle.
9. It was stated that the L.A.P.D. was involved in Arbuckle's arrest. No, the incident took place in San Francisco, and that is where Arbuckle voluntarily turned himself in.
10. Kirkpatrick stated that on the morning of February 1, 1922, Taylor had gone swimming at the Y.M.C.A. We have seen no contemporary items indicating Taylor ever went to the Y.M.C.A. In Kirkpatrick's book he states that Taylor was swimming at the Los Angeles Athletic Club that morning. That version is far more probable, as Taylor was indeed a member of the L.A. Athletic Club.
11. It was stated that February 1, 1922 was a very typical studio day for Taylor. On the contrary, Taylor only spent a very short time at the studio, since he was between pictures. He spent most of the day attending to personal business elsewhere (banking, shopping, conferring with his tax advisor, etc.).
12. Mabel Normand was described as an "unexpected visitor" to Taylor that evening. On the contrary, Taylor fully expected her, since he had telephoned and asked that she come over to pick up the books he had purchased for her.
13. It is stated that Mabel Normand was searching for letters at Taylor's home when the police arrived on the morning of February 2, 1922. But in reality she did not return to Taylor's home until February 4, two days later. She was not there on the morning of February 2.
14. The "woman's nightgown" was not found in Taylor's closet, it was in a dresser drawer.
15. It is stated that Mary Miles Minter appeared at the coroner's inquest. No, Minter was in seclusion in her home on Hobart, and did not appear at the inquest.
16. It is stated that the studios did little to help Normand in the aftermath of the murder, and that she was considered expendable. On the contrary, the Sennett studio where she worked did all they could to help her, but the amount of negative press and rumors was just overwhelming.
17. It is stated as fact that the nightgown found in Taylor's home was monogrammed with the initials "M.M.M.", and belonged to Minter. The strongest evidence is that the nightgown contained no initials and did not belong to her.
18. It is stated that Sands was found dead of "natural causes" in Connecticut. The person in Connecticut, whom many people believe was not Sands, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, not "natural causes."
19. It is stated that Shelby never was an official suspect. On the contrary, L.A.P.D. detective Jesse Winn later testified that Shelby had been considered a suspect right from the start, and the 1926 and 1937 investigations centered on Shelby as the prime suspect.
20. It is stated that the newspapers of that time would not mention rumors of homosexuality, but there were indeed such rumors mentioned at the time regarding the Taylor case.
21. It is stated that the Taylor murder also killed the film careers of Mabel Normand and Mary Miles Minter. The murder certainly had a negative impact on both careers, but it didn't kill either career. Mabel continued making films for nearly another five years. Mary Miles Minter made four more films for Paramount, which finished her 3-year contract. She was not rehired by Paramount, but she did receive offers from other film producers, which she declined.
21. It is stated that the Taylor murder led to the Hays Code. But Hays had been hired before Taylor was killed, and the formal Hays Code did not take effect until the 1930's. Any effect which the Taylor murder had on the Hays code was minimal.
22. John Gilbert did not have the squeaky voice of a schoolgirl.

Herb Howe's Last Article about Mabel Normand

No contemporary fan magazine writer was more sympathetic to Mabel Normand than Herbert Howe. The first article he wrote about her was "The Diaries of Mabel Normand," published in 1921 and reprinted in MABEL NORMAND: A SOURCE BOOK TO HER LIFE AND FILMS, by William Thomas Sherman. Several of Howe's brief contemporary items on Mabel were reprinted in TAYLOROLOGY #10. The following article is evidently the last article Howe wrote about Mabel, and was published in 1931.

April 1931 Herbert Howe NEW MOVIE MAGAZINE

Hollywood's Hall of Fame: Mabel Normand

...Probably the writer's definition of the greatest personality would be the one who supplies the best copy, the most interesting from a story angle, be he saint or devil, mental giant or movie magazine writer. That which issues from the mouth of man is but a fraction of his personal expression. A person may be fascinating and yet give a punk interview. "Interview" is a misnomer, anyhow. Usually it is just a bleating. ...Although in the past I have used the word "soul" many times like a sloven writer, I confess I do not know what it is. I seem to have a clearer idea of "heart." Perhaps the two are synonymous. Certainly greatness of heart seems to me to be the greatest ingredient for lasting charm. That is why Mabel Normand is first with me. I had heard a lot about Mabel before meeting her. Everyone always heard a lot about Mabel. I did not think I would care much for her. A practical joker, according to stories, she liked to shock in burlesque fashion. Typically Irish, I was told. Impulsive, wild-tongued. In fact, from the hearsay picture, I gathered that Mabel was a hoyden, and from a hoyden I will run as from battle. One afternoon I went with Adela Rogers St. Johns to Mahlon Hamilton's for cocktails before attending the premiere of "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse." That was years before Hollywood was scandalously headlined. There were a number of people in the drawing-room, among them several stars but no one particularly exciting. Suddenly I had the feeling that an arc lamp was flooding the room. I turned toward the door and saw a girl dressed in black, a large black hat shadowing her face, a string of tiny pearls around her throat. In her arm she carried several books which she evidently was returning. She came into the room with the shy step of a country cousin, and I noted she was pigeon-toed. Several people spoke to her but I did not get her name and no one took the trouble to introduce me. They didn't need to; I naturally gravitated. Almost at once I was immersed in the eloquence of dark eyes. I do not know whether I thought her beautiful. I was too far sunk for trivial observations. I must have had a gaspy look, for she gave me a sort of resuscitating smile and asked me if I had read the books which she placed on a table, and did I like Stephen Leacock. I said I was sure I would--if given a chance. "Let me send you this one," she said. "And there is another I think you will like. Will you give me your name and address?" I gave. It would be impossible for me to say how long we talked. I think Einstein's theory of relativity might apply, but as to that I am not clear. Anyhow I had the feeling of having known her much longer than time. She left as shyly as she had come, giving me an amused smile and offering her hand. (Curious how little details bob up in memory: I recall her telling me later that people were always giving her gloves which she detested and never wore.) As soon as she had gone I galloped to Adela: "Who is she?--I'm crazy--" "Don't be so original," booed the unpitying Adela. "Everyone is crazy about her who ever knew her. Don't tell me you haven't recognized her! She is Mabel Normand." Well, as Texas Guinan once exclaimed when similarly shocked, "I didn't know whether to commit suicide or sing 'Baby Shoes.'" Incredible as it may seem, I was not at that time a fan for Mabel's pictures. And I am one of the rare souls who never recognizes a star off the screen. I went on to the premiere of "The Four Horsemen" but I couldn't seem to keep my mind on the picture. It seemed disjointed. I was the only reviewer who failed to hail Rex Ingram a genius, and so Rex engaged me to do his publicity and we became very good friends. Thus I came under Mabel Normand's fatal spell which started operating immediately to my benefit. A few days later the Leacock books arrived with several stories marked. M. Jomier, the favorite French instructor of Hollywood, was in my apartment that afternoon. We had started to talk French but soon lapsed into an English discussion of Mabel. I found he was among those obsessed like myself. We were talking of Mabel when the telephone rang. "Do you know who this is?" asked the voice. "Yes," I said. "Why, you big liar!" "Thank you for the books," I said. "How did you know my voice?--Listen will you do something for me?" "Everything." "Not that. I don't know you well enough. But will you do my publicity? They are raising the devil with me down here at the studio." "Everything but that," I laughed. "I know you too well for that--" I meant that I knew her reputation for loathing publicity. She ran from it like a frightened child from a willow switch. It was a bitter fate that crushed her with headlines later. When now I think of her terrific aversion I wonder if it was not a premonition. She would elude interviewers with the agility of a quarried rabbit. When caught by one she would invariably beguile him into babbling of himself, and he would leave with only a rapturous impression. This was not design on her part. She had a voracious interest in people. She would rather hear a life story than tell one. Naturally sympathetic, her instinct was for liking everyone. I recall one interviewer calling in the throes of a flu-cold. Mabel made him take a hot foot-bath, gave him a toddy, bundled him up in one of her fur coats and sent him home in the care of her chauffeur. My friendship with Mabel was extraordinary so far as I am concerned, but there are countless others who can testify as I do. We know she had friends everywhere, but we did not realize how many until she died. Messages came from all parts of the world. A wealthy woman in New York, prominent in society here and abroad, wrote that she had arranged for a mass to be said every month, perpetually, for the eternal rest of Mabel. I visited an Italian orphanage where the children offer their daily prayers for her. Next to me at her funeral a boy in threadbare clothes sobbed convulsively throughout the service. No one seemed to know who he was. No one, for that matter, knows how many partook of "the great heart of Mabel." I gained a faint idea when I met her Father Confessor. I quote him when I say, "The great heart of Mabel." Mabel was endowed with intuition amounting to clairvoyance. Through her own suffering sensitiveness she understood people. On my return from a European trip six or seven years ago, she said, "I bet you miss the good wines over there." I confessed I did. "Listen, my dear," she said. "You must drink none of this stuff over here. God knows I am not a preacher or prohibitionist. My friends are welcome to drink as they choose. But I have taken a pledge." "Appreciating Mabel's humor, I laughed. "Are you a Catholic?" she asked suddenly. "No," I said, "but I went to school with Catholic boys." "I am a Catholic," laughed Mabel, "but don't hold that against the church. There are good and bad in all religions. God love them all! I am not bigoted. But there is one priest who is a miracle-worker. He saved my life, God love him. I wish you would let me introduce you to Father Chiappa, a very old Italian priest. You like Italians, don't you? Well, Father Chaippa is so saintly that when you meet him you will feel you are entering heaven. Lord knows whether you will ever feel that way hereafter, so you'd better meet him." "I would like to." "Really?" She seemed astonished. "Really." "He won't lecture you or ask you to take the pledge. He will just talk to you and make you love him. You can tell him all your sins and he will never spill the beans." "How old is he?" "Seventy-two." "He wouldn't have time to hear them all." Mabel laughed: "Will you go tomorrow?" "Tomorrow." "I don't believe you a bit. I shall call you." The next day we went to Loyola to see Father Chiappa. Mabel entered first, "to prepare him," she said, "as a sudden shock might kill him." She came out throwing kisses at the old priest who protested with upraised hands, "Mabel! Mabel!" I entered the little office and talked with Father Chiappa, a man of Christ-like gentleness over whom the earth no longer had power. When he died a few months before Mabel, I felt I had lost an unfailing friend. Such is the instant power of fine personality. Mabel was waiting for me in her car when I came out. She could scarcely restrain her excitement and the devil was in her eyes. "Did you like him?" she demanded. "Of course I liked him." "What did he say? Did he scold you? I hope he did. He didn't ask for money, now did he?" "Certainly not." "But you gave him some. I can tell. Now didn't you?" "A little for your Italian orphanage." "Why, I'll never speak to you again. How much did you give him?" I told her. "Well, of all the--! I shall never forgive you as long as I live. You can't afford it. I am surprised Father Chaippa would take it." "He didn't. I left it on the prie-dieu. I happened to pry some of your secrets out of him. I learned you had built a wing on that orphans' home." "It isn't true," said Mabel. "But tell me, what happened?" "I took the pledge for three months." "You are not telling the truth! What did you do?" "I knelt down--" "Let me see your knees!" Mabel bent over and regarded the knees of my trousers on which there were circles of dust. "Well, of all--! Wait until Mamie hears this!" Mabel bounced up and down on the seat, rapped on the window for the chauffeur to drive faster and squealed with unseemly glee. Mamie was Mabel's old white-haired Irish maid, a devout Catholic, whose devotion to Mabel was only matched by Mabel's love for her over a period of many years. "Mamie! Mamie!" screamed Mabel, throwing her arms around her maid when we had entered the house. "Mamie, Herb has been to Father Chaippa and taken the pledge. Can you beat that? Mamie, have you a drink to give him? He deserves one." "Shame on you, Mabel," said Mamie. "An' God bless you Mishter Howe." "Well, anyhow, I shall buy you a lunch at my Italian friend's across the street," said Mabel. We crossed the street to a restaurant where Mabel was received by the proprietor with genuflections such as are given the Madonna. "This Italian is a wonderful fellow," said Mabel in an awed whisper. "I gave him five hundred dollars when he was going broke and, do you know, he paid me back!" I had never seen Mabel in all her variety as she was during that lunch of five hours. She told me most of her life story. Mabel was the perfect clown. She could have you in tears of one sort or another all the time. I wonder what became of all those diaries into which Mabel scribbled her poems of joy and sorrow. I read some of them. They had the beauty of things not done for recognition. She could only show me a few. I think she must have destroyed them. The beauty of her inner self abashed her, she was so conscious of her failings. And yet I know no one of such beautiful accomplishments. I could fill the whole booksholf with anecdotes of Mabel. I do not want to speak of the world's misjudgment of her. It was the pain that killed her. Father Chaippa could have written her true story. He belonged to the Society of Jesus.

May Rupp's Accusation

The flare-up of the Taylor murder which resulted in the largest number of "arrests" resulted from the statements made by May Rupp, as indicated by the following clippings.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

March 1, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Protect Woman in Death Case

Uniformed officers were detailed to guard the home of Mrs. John Rupp, 1836 1/2 West Washington Street, last night when she appealed for protection from members of a gang whom she accused yesterday of complicity in the slaying of William Desmond Taylor, film director. Following her recital of an amazing story concerning her asserted knowledge of the murder, in which she named six men now in jail, she stated that other members of the gang as yet uncaught would attempt to kill her. While the six arrested at her home early yesterday morning by Wilshire police were being held incommunicado at Central Police Station, Mrs. Rupp made a detailed statement of her information in the District Attorney's office to Detective Sergeants Edward King and Wynn. The statement was taken by a shorthand reporter. After checking certain phases of her story the officers stated that "It looked good and provided perhaps the most important lead uncovered to date." The suspects, who are being held for the time being on suspicion of robbery, are asserted by her to have bootlegged liquor to Mr. Taylor, that two in particular informed her on the day before the murder that they had quarreled with the director over his refusal to pay them for a delivery, and in her presence threatened to kill him. She named one of the men as the probable slayer... The six men held in jail will be questioned singly today. At a late hour last night none of the men had been grilled by police. One outstanding detail of the charges made by Mrs. Rupp against them is that she confided to another woman on February 2 that she believed she knew who had killed Mr. Taylor. This woman yesterday confirmed the report that Mrs. Rupp had made this remark. The six men held incomunicado at Central station are William East, 36 years old; Walter Kirby, 23, John Herkey, 25; Ray Lynch, 26; George Calvert, 25, and Harry Amorheim, 27. They were arrested at Mrs. Rupp's home on West Washington Street, where, she stated, she served as their housekeeper. Mrs. Rupp's story, if it is authentic, has provided the investigators for the first time with a motive for the slaying of William Desmond Taylor, a crime of a most mysterious character which has aroused interest in two continents. Her story is that of "a woman scorned," relating that one of the men now held prisoner and with whom she had been on very friendly terms, had thrown her aside for another woman. The men, she said, have been in hiding since the day Mr. Taylor's body was discovered. The men, she asserted, had sold several consignments of liquor to Mr. Taylor, which had been represented to him as bonded liquor. The last consignment proved to be only bootleg liquor which Mr. Taylor is said to have refused to accept, this act of his having aroused the ire of illicit dealers. Mrs. Rupp declared she became cognizant of their activities and possible knowledge of the murder when one night two of the men returned to her home, where they were residing also, and entered into an altercation, during which she said she heard of a vengeance plot to kill somebody. Later, she added, these two men declared the person previously mentioned had double-crossed them, following which statement, she continued, the plan to kill him was told to her. Mrs. Rupp said she accused them of killing Mr. Taylor, following the murder, and was told: "My -----, don't mention that." "The Taylor murder mystery is solved if Mrs. Rupp is telling the truth," Detective Sergeant Herman Cline, commander of the newly created police homicide squad, declared last night...

March 1, 1922 SACRAMENTO BEE Los Angeles--...Mrs. Rupp, who is ill and in bed, is guarded by the police at her home. The detectives said they had previous acquaintance with her, Sergeant Baldridge declaring she was "an eccentric" and had once attempted suicide after a quarrel with a sweetheart. The officers said that in investigating her story they were taking into account their previous knowledge of her as well as the possibility she might be actuated by a motive of jealousy. A short time before Taylor was slain, according to the police re-statement of Mrs. Rupp's story, two of the six men returned to her home, and told her: "He double-crossed us; wouldn't pay for the booze we brought him. We'll get the -----. We're going to kill him." The name of the director was not spoken, however, it was stated. Mrs. Rupp said she dismissed the threat from her mind until the day after the murder. Then, she said, while she and the two men were at dinner, she suddenly cried out to one of them: "You are the man who killed Taylor!" "He turned perfectly white and sagged in his chair," Mrs. Rupp was quoted. "Then he said: 'Good God! Don't say that again! Don't ever mention that again!'" "I never did," Mrs. Rup was said to have continued, "but during the next two weeks, one man would frequently come running into the house and hide in his room. Once he said to me: 'The bulls are after me! Help me hide!'" Mrs. Rupp was said to have given the police the name of an alleged bootlegger from whom the six men were reported to have obtained the liquor were charged with having sold. The officers were said to be searching for this man. "The morning after the murder," Mrs. Rupp was quoted, "I said to my landlady, 'I know who killed Taylor.'" Mrs. Edith Spitzer, 1819 South Normandie Avenue, who owns the house where Mrs. Rupp lived, was said by the police to have confirmed this statement. The officers declared this corroboration proved Mrs. Rupp had not "manufactured" her story recently...

March 1, 1922 HARTFORD COURANT Los Angeles--...Two days before the shooting of Taylor, the police declare she informed them, Kirby and Calvert uttered threats against the film director for "injuring their business." The two, she said, were extremely nervous on the night of February 1, when Taylor was killed, and were away from the place during the early evening. Both stayed up all night.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

March 2, 1922 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE Los Angeles--...A new arrest in the William D. Taylor murder investigation is imminent as the result of information which confirms certain phases relating to the arrest of six men Tuesday morning. The new suspect is said to be a motion picture actor of some standing and to have been the confidante of several clever criminals, two of whom were arrested several months ago by Federal agents. The six men held in the city jail on suspicion of robbery, who are asserted by Mrs. John Rupp to be members of a bootlegging gang which quarreled with the film director, were grilled by detectives today. George Calvert, also known as Rodney Calvert, alleged to be one of a band of bootleggers that supplied Roscoe Arbuckle with liquor, was named by Mrs. Rupp as the man she says threatened in her presence to kill Taylor. The result of the questioning of the six men arrested in Mrs. Rupp's apartment was not divulged, but it was rumored that important disclosures were made and that one of the men was on the verge of "breaking." The new arrest predicted concerns an individual mentioned by Mrs. Rupp in her statement as an associate of the men in custody. She did not state his connection with the case clearly, but confidential information seems to indicate that he is in possession of the facts of the slaying... The statement made under oath today by Mrs. Rupp was 10,000 words in length and mentioned the names of several prominent motion picture actors, some whose names have been brought out in the investigation of Taylor's murder. Her statement also revealed that Mrs. Rupp had attempted suicide following a brutal beating which she declared was given her by certain members of the gang. Throughout her interview with the detectives, all of which was recorded by a shorthand reporter, she referred to the "poison" which she had taken, of the remarks made by some of the men now under arrest, whom she said had exclaimed, "Let her die," when they learned of her condition, and of the threats of death of prevent her from "squealing." In declaring Calvert was the man who had threatened to take Taylor's life, the woman said he was enraged and alarmed by the film director's threat to break up his illicit liquor traffic because Calvert had sent him synthetic whisky represented to be bonded liquor. Since the men were arrested, none but officials have access to them. Mrs. Rupp's house at 1836 1/2 West Washington Street has been under police guard. Mrs. Rupp is ill. She says the men tried to asphyxiate her to keep her from telling her story to the authorities. More than twenty-four hours have elapsed since Mrs. Rupp first told her story, and although all the resources of the police and Sheriff's office have been used to test it, the story stands intact in every material detail. Mrs. Rupp's statement is the first of the "confessions" to really impress the investigators. She admits informing the police because she wants revenge on one of the men, a sweetheart, she says "threw her down," but to prove she did not make up the story on the spur of the moment, has sent the detectives to a woman who substantiated her statement that Mrs. Rupp told her the day after the murder, that she knew who killed Taylor. According to Mrs. Rupp's statement, the six men, including two who came from Chicago some time ago, operated a bootlegging and narcotic peddling trade among the Hollywood motion picture folk. Arbuckle was one of their customers, Mrs. Rupp said. Taylor had bought liquor from the men, but their usual source of supply being shut off, they sent him moonshine and said it was the usual bonded goods. The woman says Calvert is wanted in Chicago for "a terrible crime." Taylor detected the fraud immediately and not only refused to pay Calvert, but threatened to break up his trade, Mrs. Rupp declared. It was this threat that caused Calvert to say he would kill Taylor. She says on the night of the murder Calvert and another of the men were away from the house in the evening and after returning stayed up all night. She accused Calvert of the murder, she said, and he became pale and told her "never to mention that again." The companions of Calvert are booked as William East, laborer; Walter Kirby, studio property man; John Herkey, sheet metal worker, and Harry Amorheim (probably Arnheim), chauffeur. Calvert said he was a gas fitter.

March 2, 1922 ARIZONA REPUBLICAN Los Angeles--...Mrs. Rupp, who is said to be known also as Mrs. May Lynch...stated that after the murder, when she accused one of the men of it, he beat her severely and warned her not to mention the matter again. It was the treatment she received from the men that finally resulted in her giving information against them to the police...

March 2, 1922 NEW YORK NEWS Los Angeles--...Mrs. Rupp is also known as May Lynch, and she has been in trouble with the police on more than one occasion because of her association with drug peddlers. She recently quarreled with Harry Lynch, one of the men under arrest, and her story directly implicates him in the Taylor mystery. He has denied to the police knowing anything of the murder, though he admits knowing Taylor, and he has offered an alibi which the police are now examining closely. The Rupp woman's story is that Taylor became inflamed with anger over the poor quality of the liquor which the bootleggers had supplied him with a few days before he was killed. He called one of the gang on the telephone, she says, and denounced him and the rest of the crew, in unmeasured terms, swearing he would put an end to their traffic in drugs, of which he was aware, because they had double-crossed him on his liquor supply. Two film beauties, one at least closely identified with Taylor, were customers of the dope peddlers, Mrs. Rupp says, and Taylor knew this. He had tried in vain to break this woman of the habit and had often vowed to take drastic measures to stop the traffic. But his words only threatened to crystalize into action when he was convinced he himself was the victim of the gang's duplicity in their bootlegging operations. Knowing him to be a man of his word and with powerful influences, the gang, Mrs. Rupp says, held a conference in her house after he had denounced them over the telephone. She overheard some of the conversation which ensued, she says. Two of them, whom she names, declared that something must be done to stop Taylor form taking action. One of the gang proposed taking back the shipment of hootch and substituting good liquor, but the leader of the gang, Mrs. Rupp says, was opposed to this as too expensive a way of settling the trouble.... Mrs. Rupp told the police that the same crew of bootleggers supplied Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle with liquors, which were such a feature of his Hollywood entertainments and performed similar services for other screen favorites of both sexes. Any drug or narcotic desired was supplied by them at fancy prices, she says...

March 2, 1922 SEATTLE STAR Los Angeles--Ramifications of the bootlegging industry extending into the realm of the motion picture profession were uncovered today with the institution of a search by detectives for a well known screen actor named by Mrs. John Rupp in connection with the murder of William D. Taylor ...The bootlegging of liquor and drugs was not the only business conducted by the gang now held incommunicado at the central station, the informant intimated. "Any job wanted could be arranged through this actor," was the way Mrs. Rupp expressed it. Detective Sergeant Cline said today that he believed this actor, knowing all the secrets of the underworld gangsters, and their contact with the film world, would be able to give the police the facts of the "movie murder." Detectives were trying to locate him. It was believed he would be found before night.

March 2, 1922 ST. LOUIS GLOBE-DEMOCRAT Los Angeles--...The organization of bootleggers is the same that supplied Fatty Arbuckle with liquor, according to Mrs. Rupp. She also named two of the leading motion picture actresses on the west coast, as regular customers of the bootleggers. Mrs. Rupp declared that the agents made regular trips to several studios which she named. Deliveries were made one day and collections another, according to her statement. She said once in their presence: "I know who killed Taylor. It was ----- -----," naming one of the men. Her half-jesting remark brought a storm of oaths and commands for her to keep quiet from all of the men, she says. Later she heard the two she suspected discussing her. They were saying that they had better get her out of the way before she told something. Mrs. Rupp, who is also known as May Lynch, quarreled with Harry Lynch, one of the men taken in the raid, and charged with robbery. Despondent, she drank poison and was in a serious condition at her home when the two men she suspects of the Taylor murder came in. She declares in her statement that the men disconnected a rubber hose that fed a gas heater, turned on the gas and held the hose against her face, hoping to asphyxiate her. Before the succeeded, a police ambulance arrived and she was taken to the Receiving Hospital, where police surgeons saved her life. Mrs. Rupp also stated the suspects, alarmed at what they feared she would tell, planned to get out of Los Angeles on a freight train. The men she had been housing tried to take her victrola and sell it to give them a stake on which to leave the city.

March 2, 1922 CHICAGO HERALD-EXAMINER Los Angeles--...Back of the slaying of William Desmond Taylor was more than a mere row over bootleg whisky, according to an amplified story told detectives today by Mrs. John Rupp, otherwise known as Mrs. Lynch. Mr. Taylor had been angered, she said, by receiving poor quality liquor from his bootleggers, who she points out as his murderers, and the fact that a woman friend, dear to his heart, had become seriously ill as a result of drinking some of the stuff. Mrs. Rupp today told the police the tongue-lashing Mr. Taylor had given the bootleggers had been primarily based upon the illness of this woman--an actress, though not a star of the first magnitude. Her name has been mentioned on a number of occasions since the director's death, in connection with the case, and for a considerable time Mr. Taylor was known to have been in love with her. It seems that but a short time before his death, if Mrs. Rupp's story is to be credited, this actress and a friend were at Mr. Taylor's home and while there drank considerable portions of the stock said to have been obtained from two of the men now in jail. The next day both were very ill drom drinking this liquor and Mr. Taylor, calling the bootleggers on the telephone, ordered them to come to his house. When they arrived he is said not only to have refused to pay for the stock but to have charged them with responsibility for his friends' illness. The manner in which Mrs. Rupp told this to the police convinces the officers that a part of her story, at least, is true. She said she heard the men discussing this phase of the case and had overheard the name of the woman. It was a name unfamiliar to her and she recalled it only when the officers had repeated to her the names of all the stars and near-stars who have been mentioned in connection with the murder. Her story took such proportions today that the district attorney, who for several days has taken little part in the investigation, indicated a desire to question her personally and put her through such an examination as to determine at once the truth or falsity of her statements... It was Lynch who indirectly caused the woman to "tip off" the police, for after a row with her several days ago, she says he beat her. In retaliation she told the police all she knew, she said.

March 2, 1922 MINNEAPOLIS JOURNAL Six Called Innocent of Taylor Murder

Los Angeles--...The six men arrested on information furnished by Mrs. John Rupp, their housekeeper, had no connection with the murder of William D. Taylor, motion picture director, it was announced today by Detective Sergeant Herman Cline, in charge of the investigation. He said examination of Mrs. Rupp and investigation convinced the detectives that there was no foundation to her statements that they had threatened the life of Taylor...

March 2, 1922 SHREVEPORT TIMES Los Angeles--..The story of Mrs. John Rupp, which led to the arrest of seven men, was discarded by the police as "imaginative and based on a desire for revenge." The men will be held, however, while the police try to connect them with several small robberies...

Taylor Fighting Censorship

In 1921 there were renewed efforts to impose national censorship of motion pictures, and also efforts to install a municipal censor in Los Angeles. These efforts ultimately failed, due in part to the appointment of Will Hays as head of the film industry. William Desmond Taylor was one of the leaders of the anti-censorship forces, and the following item was given wide distribution when Los Angeles was considering municipal censorship during September 1921. [Thanks to Charles Higham for providing a copy of this document.]

The Nonsense of Censorship by William D. Taylor President-director of the Motion Picture Directors' Association, Los Angeles Lodge

Censorship of motion pictures is a menace to the very principles of the Constitution of these United States of America. How strong a grasp it has obtained over the constitutional rights of America may be seen in the fact that nearly one-third of the total population of this country may now see only such motion pictures as come commission has decided they may see. True there are but six states where pre-censorship of ideas has been made legal. These are Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. But the population of these six states totals thirty-two million persons. Nor are actual residents of these states the only ones imposed upon; in many cases film exchanges located in censorship territory furnish motion pictures to a large outlying district. It is obviously difficult to re- insert scenes that once have been deleted. In addition to the states mentioned a number of cities have imposed on their people a local motion picture censorship. Up to now, loyal Americans who believe in upholding the fundamental principles on which this free nation was founded have been to a great extent successful in stamping out threatened censorship in its incipiency. Among states that repudiated film censorship measures during 1921 legislative sessions are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont and Washington. Many municipalities likewise turned down censorship propositions. Now this city of Los Angeles, world's centre for motion pictures, is threatened by a group of well meaning but poorly informed reformers with a situation that would almost instantaneously cause every state and every city that has frowned on censorship to reconsider. They want to censor films in Los Angeles. They want to look at that picture before it has been shown on any public screen and tell the producer of that picture what he must or must not show. The ominous meaning of the censor in American life has seeped its way into the consciousness of some of them. This group wants the word "censor" dropped. "Call it motion picture commission" they say. A censor by any other name is just as sour. There is no place for a censor of motion picture publication in a country whose constitution guarantees its citizens free publication by speech, by picture and by the press. Censorship by any name is un-American. Not only un-American--unnecessary. There are laws on the statute books of every state, every city, that amply protect against the salacious, the immoral or the demoralizing. Just as it is the duty of every citizen to report to the police authorities any violations of the criminal code that come to his notice, so is it his duty to report to the police authorities any violations of the laws of morality or of social welfare he may see on the screen of the motion picture theatre. If a scene he objects to cannot be suppressed by the police power it could not legally be suppressed by censor power. His resource in such a case is to boycott such a theatre and to notify the theatre manager of his action and the reason for it. The arguments against censorship are too well known to dwell on at any length. Every school child who knows the true history of the founding of the United States of America can argue against censorship as forcefully as the most polished orator or accomplished advocate. Will Los Angeles stand for a censorship within its gates? Tell the City Council what YOU think about it.

Flashes of Neva Gerber

Because of the central role Neva Gerber played in the life of William Desmond Taylor from 1914-1919, we have long hoped to devote an entire issue of TAYLOROLOGY to her. Unfortunately we have found contemporary items on her to be very elusive and fragmentary, and we have never found any substantial interviews with her in any of the silent film fan magazines. A few interviews were published in the aftermath of the Taylor murder, and those interviews were reprinted in TAYLOROLOGY 60, 62 and 86. A recent career article was published in the February 1999 issue of CLASSIC IMAGES and is available online at http://www.classicimages.com/1999/february99/gerber.html The following are a few contemporary fragments pertaining to Neva Gerber which have crossed our path.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

November 9, 1912 MOTOGRAPHY Neva Gerber is the substitute for Miss Christie in George Melford's company of Kalem players at Glendale, Cal. Miss Christie's going to New York meant Miss Gerber's first appearance in pictures in which she is playing leads.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

May 16, 1914 MOTOGRAPHY Edwin August is gradually getting a very strong company together for his Feature Films and his first independent feature, the adaptation of a famous novel, is well on the way. J. Farrell MacDonald, the producer of Samson and other successes is the director and Neva Delorez, a young, beautiful and experienced actress, is acting opposite August. With Hal August, Eugene Ormonde and Edith Bostwick, Jack Weatherbee and Layola O'Connor in the cast and with Frank Ormston as technical director and Mary O'Connor looking after the scenarios, Mr. August has a company and staff of extraordinary strength.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

June 6, 1914 NEW YORK CLIPPER Edwin August has completed his first feature picture for the Balboa company, and is going to produce a comedy drama with a new idea running through it. He has moved to Long Beach and occupies a delightful apartment there. He has lots of nice things to say regarding both his juvenile, Hal August, and his leading lady, Neva Delorez.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

July 25, 1914 MOVIE PICTORIAL Whilst waiting in an automobile downtown recently, Neva Gerber of William D. Taylor's Balboa company, was reproved by a social worker for having so much paint on her face. When the other actors arrived the lady fled without apologies.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

March 20, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD [This item is very fanciful.] Neva Gerber, playing opposite to Carlyle Blackwell in "The High Hand," the next Favorite Players production, is the daughter of the late S. Nelson Gerber, for years the most prominent criminal lawyer in Chicago. Miss Gerber is a daughter of the Sunny South, and granddaughter of the late William Younge, Governor of Kentucky, and a direct descendent of John Wentworth, first Governor of New Hampshire, appointed by the English crown. She is closely related to General Benjamin F. Butler. Driving high-powered autos and aeroplanes is Miss Gerber's hobby. She has to her credit having driven the ninety-horsepower Mercedes car which the great racer, De Palma, drove, and in which he has braved death several times. She is but a slip of a girl, but is one of the most daring automobile drivers, and is well known among the auto jockeys of California. Miss Gerber is a graduate of the Convent of the Imacculate Heart, and a finished pianist. She is very fond of her very famous thoroughbred bull "Brutus," who is her constant companion. Neva Gerber played opposite to Carlyle Blackwell in the Kalem Co., opposite to Hal August in the Edwin August Feature Films and was leading woman for William D. Taylor's Balboa Company. George Melford, now directing for the Lasky Company, is responsible for Miss Gerber's being in motion pictures, and he is justly proud of his find. She played leads in "Criminal Code" and "An Eye for an Eye" under the direction of Wiliam D. Taylor with the Balboa and "The Detective's Sister" with Carlyle Blackwell in the Kalem Company; also "The Great Secret" and "The Awakening" in the Edwin August Feature Films. Coincidentally Miss Gerber finds herself again associated with William D. Taylor as her director and Carlyle Blackwell as her "hero."

July 5, 1915 NEW YORK CLIPPER Neva Gerber, who plays the leading role in "The Redemption of the Jasons," a new American "Beauty" release, is the swiftest runner in the American studios at Santa Barbara. Miss Gerber, who always has been an athlete, recently won ten pounds of candy from Webster Campbell, who plays opposite her. She wagered she could defeat Campbell in a one hundred yards dash. She did.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

August 21, 1915 NEW YORK CLIPPER Neva Gerber, of the Beauty Brand, visited Los Angeles for the first time since she joined the Flying A company, some months back. Neva states that she likes Santa Barbara immensely and that she and her mother have a small bungalow and lots of callers. Neva has advanced in her work considerably of late, and is quite popular.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

November 13, 1915 PHOTO-PLAY REVIEW Neva Gerber acknowledges that she possesses a peculiar name but it is her very own. She changed it once when acting opposite Edwin August who did not think it sounded romantic enough, so for a time she was billed as Neva Dolorez but she turned back to "Gerber" when she left August to play with Carlyle Blackwell.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

April 8, 1916 PHOTOPLAYERS WEEKLY Neva Gerber has been offered and has accepted an engagement with the B. & L. Company at San Mateo, and leaves Los Angeles for the north at the end of the week. Neva has been considering several offers, but this one attracts her, as she likes the idea of a change of location and wants to see more of San Francisco. Neva Gerber and Sadie Lindblom are opposites and they should get along famously together.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

April 22, 1916 PHOTOPLAYERS WEEKLY Lena Baskette, the nine-year-old Universal dancer who unaccompanied went to visit her father at San Mateo last week, was witness and aid to the rescue of Neva Gerber and Earle Emlay from death by drowning in the Feather River near Beldon. The man who made the rescue was Lena's father, Frank E. Baskette, clubman and wealthy druggist of San Mateo. Mr. Baskette and his little daughter accompanied the B. & L. Film Company, who went to Beldon for the taking of water scenes. Mr. Baskette was the first to notice that the wire fastening the boat containing the actor and the actress had broken. The occupants were hurled into the stream and Frank Smith, a guide, twice attempted to reach them, but was hurled against a boulder and D. H. Roberts, Western Passenger Agent, went to his assistance. Mr. Baskette jumped into the river, but the man and woman had disappeared for the second time before he came within reach of them. They were unconscious when the San Mateo clubman succeeded in dragging them to a rock which stood above the water. Lena remained calm during the struggle for life which she saw before her, and directed her father toward the spot where the drowning people had last appeared. She offered her car to whoever might need it and thankfully clung to her father. Miss Gerber and Mr. Emlay were rushed to a hospital, and the former was found to be in a serious condition from breakdown and a skull adhesion.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

September 22, 1917 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Neva Gerber was operated upon for appendicitis at the Clara Barton Hospital, Los Angeles, on August 23. The operation was a success, but it will be at least a month before Miss Gerber will be in satisfactory condition for the resumption of her work and then only to play in scenes requiring but little effort on her part.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

October 6, 1917 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Neva Gerber returned to her home in Hollywood last Monday from the hospital, where an operation for appendicits had been performed upon this Universal star two weeks previously. Miss Gerber is gaining strength rapidly and her physician says she will be able to resume her work at Universal City in about three weeks. She has the leading feminine role in the serial, "The Phantom Ship," which is being produced under the direction of Francis Ford.

More Gossip from Capt. Billy's Whiz Bang

In TAYLOROLOGY 74 we reprinted some gossip from the humor magazine CAPT. BILLY'S WHIZ BANG. Some TAYLOROLOGY readers have requested more of the same, so here is the first gossip column contained in that publication.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

August 1920 CAPT. BILLY'S WHIZ BANG

Hollywood Heart-Breakers

The following article is the first of a series that will depict the more intimate life of the movie actors and actresses who make their headquarters in the vicinity of Los Angeles. This series is in no sense to be considered "press agent dope." THE WHIZ BANG, in this series, proposes to tell its readers of the little romances of their favorite screen star--of lives strewn with mobilized immoderation, fickle faithlessness and dark desolation. As an actress once told me: "Our step is pep; our creed is speed."

by Marion

Hollywood, beautiful little suburb of Los Angeles and famous as America's leading movie hot-house, is running pretty nowadays with its many wondrous autos and, Oh! those numerous and naughty little, palpitating bungalow intrigues. The Mary Pickford-Doug Fairbanks romance, is almost old stuff with Mary and Doug on a bit of a honeymoon in New York and London, while forty eleven representatives of the daily papers accompanied them as far as Arizona to watch the Moki Indians get their first glimpse of the screen. One of the merriest rumors just now extant regards another member of the Pickford family, to-wit, Lottie. Lottie is a live wire in the parlance of the country clubs and cafes. In southern California, until the "prohis" bore down, the word "country club" meant one of the nightly places of revelry, stretched all the way from Vernon to the beach. These places are somewhat on the blink now, but it has been known that a stray "shot in the arm" has been seen to take effect. In fact a wagon load recently was taken to the police station from Vernon. But getting back to Lottie. For a considerable number of moons the night black eyes of Mary's sister beamed favorably upon a certain handsome Apollo of the screens. It wasn't a case of, wherever Mary went the boy was sure to go. It was a case of, wherever Lottie went she took the boy along. At ball games, country clubs, bungalow dances, midnight revelries, Lottie and her lad were together. Then came dame rumor, and she is a busy dame in these parts. Lottie's man was playing with another. So far as the public was concerned that was about all there was to it. But know ye, that Fatty Arbuckle, Roscoe he wishes to be called of late, rented the handsome home on West Adams Street, formerly occupied by Theda Bara. In fact it is said that Fatty sleeps in the vampire's bed, which may or may not, weave his dreams with vampires and their dangerous moods. Fatty recently gave a party. He gives a lot of them. There were picture girls galore and the wine flowed red and every other way, for Roscoe is no derelict of a host. It didn't take twenty-four hours for Dame Rumor and her children to scatter the news that "there was some runction among the 'Janes' out to Arbuckle's joint last night." Just how it started was lost in the hurry of getting down to the absolute certainty that Lottie Pickford and another girl staged one of the prettiest scraps seen since Charlie Chaplin tried to lick his wife's manager at the Alexandria hotel recently. In fact the efforts of Charlie as a pugilist are said to have been nil compared with the flavor that Lottie and her rival put up. It wasn't exactly Lottie's rival either, so the story goes. Seems that Lottie and another girl were talking in one of the bedrooms regarding the "cat" who had vamped the temporary affections of Lottie's former beau. A third girl was lying, supposedly asleep. She arose suddenly and challenged, in behalf of her vamping friend, what Lottie had said. Then the riot started. One of our well known artists stated next day that it was the best he had seen since Young George and Steve Dalton first met at Jack Doyle's. Anyone taking a good look at Lottie would opine that the girl, when angry, might be worth a bet in the real money book. Not much has been heard of Jack Pickford since he became mixed up in the war time mess. It was no Hollywood secret that Jack was not an over welcome visitor at the home of Mary and her mother for some time. Things may have been calmed over since Mary settled down with Doug, or rather tried to settle down with him. Olive Thomas, Jack's wife, recently returned from New York and Jack met her with a Whiz Bang of a new car. Jack claims it cost him bucks to the number of ten thou. Speaking of automobiles, Roscoe Arbuckle recently received a specially designed motor car that is a humdinger. The price is reportedly at $25,000. If it didn't cost that much it sure looks it. thousands of people viewed the monstrosity for a week in the windows of the motor works where it was turned out. Of course the machine is simply to be used as an ad for the prolific Fat. Some of the last words in autos have been seen around here, but they all faded to a sickly, measly brown when Arbuckle's came into prominence. Arbuckle says he intends dazzling Broadway with it. What may help some, if he uses it in New York, is the license number, which was displayed while the car stood on exhibition here. The number was "606." "United Artists," the "Big Four" and "Associated Directors" are familiar terms here. Speaking of United Artists, we must pause at mention of Charlie Chaplin and Mildred Harris. They are not united, not so anyone can notice. Shortly after their marriage last year, the doll-like little Mildred and her mother were the observed of all observers at the fashionable St. Catherine hotel, the Wrigley's island palace at Catalina. Wistful indeed, appeared the little girl as she sat day after day gazing across the Pacific blue whence fly the famous Chaplin hydroplanes from the mainland. The hydroplanes are a venture of Sid Chaplin. Charlie is not in on the deal, though he makes the air trip occasionally. But never did Charlie appear to the knowledge of the vastly interested hotel habitues. Ever with her slender, keen looking mother, the bride waited in vain for her Lochinvar. Occasionally she danced with a visiting picture personage. But Charlie--he came not. Friends--friends always spread bad news--whispered that something was wrong. The St. Catherine seemed a haven, welcome or not, of disconsolate women. On the broad veranda sat the woman discarded by Earl Williams. Inquisitive society dames raised their very proper eyebrows as they passed and the mournful looking girl appeared as lonesome as any girl could feel, even though Earl had, through his lawyers, handed over a settlement admitted to be at least $40,000. Charlie Chaplin has all the earmarks of a rather distraught young man. He lives at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. From his studio comes the word that though he finally is working at another picture, his people never know whether it will be a week or a month before he shows up to don the old derby and the familiar shoes. The fight between Chaplin and Manager Young of Mildred Chaplin was funny. Young is fat and the idea of Chaplin trying to use his fists is funnier than anything he ever did in pictures. Just what the real cause of combat was hasn't been thoroughly dissected by the scandal mongers. Young says he was trying to protect Mrs. Chaplin from annoyance by her husband. Chaplin says Young is a big stiff and that he (Chaplin) certainly never annoyed his wife. He hasn't--in public--because they never appear together. Just how the divorce proceedings will work out nobody knows. It is true that Chaplin wishes he was out of it. It is believed that Mrs. Chaplin's mother is somewhat of a business woman and will have considerable to say before the bones of the affair have rattled their last. Fairbanks and Chaplin are very close friends. One of the newspapers recently published a picture of Mary, Doug and Charlie, purporting to be one taken immediately after the marriage, when Chaplin went to the train with them as they left for an alleged brief scurry to some quiet haunt. As a matter of fact the picture was one taken at the time the trio were leaving on their famous Liberty Loan jaunt, upon which momentous trip Doug and Mary are supposed to have "fallen" for each other good and hard. Poor Owen Moore has become a public goat. The former husband of Mary is a likable enough fellow, quiet and with a winning way that can't restrain the undoubtable sadness which lurks in a pair of wistful eyes. By the way, ninety-nine women out of a hundred probably would "kotow" to Moore so far as looks are concerned, rather than to Fairbanks. Moore is well set up and handsome in a masculine way. Doug never could be called a thing of beauty and most of his cowboys display better physical form than the agile laughmaker. All the testimony given by Mary at Minden would tend to indicate that the hour in which Owen did not inject a lot of booze into himself, was a rare hour indeed. If Mary asked Owen to come back to her as often as she says she did; figuring he was the lusher as she sets forth, then indeed Owen, if he loves the girl, hasn't much of a kick coming. The general opinion appears to be that Moore had the love of Mary very much at heart but through his tendency for liquor, finally lost out. Those who really known Mary Pickford swear by the character of the girl. Those who really know Moore can't dislike him. They simply figure he was his own worst enemy and that in the desperate moments of her mental torture the girl grew to care for the light-hearted Fairbanks and his blithesome way. Poor Owen is just now figuring in a suit for damages brought by someone from whom he rented a house. The owners claim that everything was in a mess when they came back and that an overflow of booze has considerably depreciated the furniture. Another Hollywood "Secret" has been shattered. It seems that a perfectly good married man went on a visit to his "Secret" and before the evening was done he was driving a joyful bunch of other men, with their "Secrets," in his latest buzz wagon. Everything would have been O.K. but for the fact that the happy hubby permitted his own "Secret" to sit in the back seat while helping the other reveling benedicts to deliver their "Secrets" home. It appears that the "Secret" of the car-owner went to sleep in her recess in the rear of the car. The night was foggy. So was the brain of this "perfectly good" married man. He parked the car in his garage, forgetting all about the "Secret" lying asleep in the back seat. Next morning a "perfectly trusting" wife was surprised, when she stepped onto the bungalow rear, to see a "perfectly wild Secret" dashing madly out of the garage, clad in anything but up-to-date morning garb.

D. W. Griffith Comments on the Taylor Case

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

February 3, 1922 CHICAGO TRIBUNE William D. Taylor, movie director, found shot to death in his Los Angeles home, was well known among motion picture men of Chicago. Among the leaders who knew Mr. Taylor is David Wark Griffith. "He was always looked upon as highly progressive in his principles and was undoubtedly one of the best directors in the profession," said Mr. Griffith yesterday. "He was with Famous Players for a long time and did wonderful work for them. His profession has lost one of its leaders. Even though it should develop Taylor was slain through a jealousy motive, that fact should not lead the public to hold a blot against Hollywood, it being a mistake to picture the Los Angeles movie colony as a seamy center of decadence, Mr. Griffith maintained.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

February 10, 1922 CINCINNATI COMMERICAL TRIBUNE "The motion picture industry should not be condemned because one or two persons out of its personnel of many thousand workers have been guilty of indiscreet acts," David Wark Griffith, premier motion picture director of America, said yesterday in discussing some of the crimes that have shaken filmdom to its foundations. "The rotters should be kicked out of the business, and sooner or later they will be. "The fact that they have managed to get in will not disgrace the industry; it is too big for that. Ministers sometimes get into scrapes, but that doesn't mean the Christian religion is disgraced forever." Mr. Griffith said that he had never known, seen or talked to William Desmond Taylor, film director, slain recently in his Los Angeles home. He added that he had not been in California for three years, and that none of his pictures had been made there during the last six years. "All I know about Hollywood," he said in answer to a question, "is what I have read in the papers. But I imagine there must be some fire where there is so much smoke." The famous director visited the Shubert Theater, where his latest production, "Orphans of the Storm," is being shown, and spoke to the crowd between acts. He told his audience that the strongest plot for a motion picture was "the simple, old-fashioned love story about nothing in particular." Mr. Griffith was taken to the City Hall yesterday by Edward Rowland, manager of the Schubert Theater, and welcomed by Mayor George P. Carrol.

February 12, 1922 J.B. Calvo DAYTON JOURNAL ...David Wark Griffith has made a sincere effort to give productions that are both staged and acted--not just hastily thrown together scenes paraded before fast-clicking cameras. In an interview this week Mr. Griffith predicted that just such things at the Taylor murder and the Arbuckle disgrace would hasten to improve the movies by driving from the profession those whose only assets were shapely legs or baby-doll faces. "With the novelty wearing off, the public is demanding acting, not paint and powder and wide-staring eyes," Mr. Griffith said. "Baby-doll faces have had their day and the movie of tomorrow will be one that will be staged and rehearsed and produced with the greatest attention to detail. In other words, moving pictures of tomorrow will contain actors and actresses, not mere pretty marionettes."

February 16, 1922 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Warning his audience against the "think as I think; do as I do" fanatical minority, David Wark Griffith, moving picture producer, yesterday made a general defense of the industry in which he is such a prominent figure and pleaded for a greater tolerance at a luncheon of the Advertising Club of New York at its headquarters, 47 East Twenty-Fifth Street. Mr. Griffith did not undertake to reply specifically to the charges of the Rev. Dr. John Roach Straton, not even alluding to his attack on the stage and the films. Nor did he attempt a detailed defense of the moving picture colony at Hollywood. Mr. Griffith said, in fact, that he knew nothing about Hollywood, hadn't been there in four years and didn't know very many film people. He has known and does know women and men in the moving picture game who are "as sweet and clean as any women in the world," women that any of the men present would be glad to have as wives or sisters. Referring to his production of "Intolerance," which deals with the old witchcraft persecutions, Mr. Griffith said that he did not enjoy producing that story, but considered it a duty to do so. "Let one, two or three start on the mad hunt and the whole pack is again heard," continued Mr. Griffith; "and how they hunt them down and persecute them! History tells us that nine million men and women fell victims of this dread thing. How they made them suffer! They dismembered the living, tore nails from their finger--all for religion. Yet this was not religion. "It was the class that says 'Think as I think, do as I do,' and if you do not think as they think and do as they do off comes your head. "This type of man is very much alive in America today. We who have a land and a Constitution bought by the blood of countless sacrifices must be on our guard lest these 'think-as-I-think-do-as-I-do' people rob us of this heritage. "The power of the sincere fanatical minority is tremendous, and lest we watch our step law will be added to law to further circumvent our liberties. One law and then another law is put on the statute books to make people good by law--a gross, absurd impossibility. Laws that are not obeyed are disregarded until we lose respect for all laws. "No, I don't know anything about the morals of Hollywood, but I was raised in a strict Methodist family in Kentucky. It was the strictest sort of a family. Theatres and dances were barred absolutely and I knew how good those good men and women were. I know men and women engaged in producing motion pictures that you or I would be glad to have in our families. "This sounds like a defense of the movies. But there should be no defense. Shall we attack banks when a banker gets into the newspapers or the church when a minister gets into the newspapers? There is nothing new in finding conditions such as the papers have been telling about recently. In this morning's paper I saw that a priest had been arrested charged with the murder of his brother. A few days ago I read that the records of the Atlanta penitentiary show three minister inmates to each actor. "Neither the actor nor the minister should be in prison. It doesn't mean anything against the religion of Christ if occasionally a minister falls from grace. The moving picture people are just the same as all the other humans who people this earth. They are just as high as the plumber, the bricklayer or the farmer and just as low as those who dream of [...] beauty and gold to their idealism. I have seen such sweet ideals, such sweet dreams in our business. This is not just talk, but the plain truth." Mr. Griffith explained his lack of knowledge of Hollywood gossip by saying that his work occupied his time from fourteen to fifteen hours each day. Frank Feldman, president of the club, in presenting Mr. Griffith introduced him as the dean of the motion picture business and declared that if that industry had more Griffiths it would not have had many of the troubles of the last few years.

March 3, 1922 BUFFALO EXPRESS "In this uneasy day, with dissatisfaction on all sides, it may be well for us to see that nothing happens to jeopardize our glorious freedom and destroy our present form of democratic government." This statement was made by David Wark Griffith, motion picture producer, who was in Buffalo yesterday on private business and spoke to audiences at the Criterion theater, where his latest film spectacle, Orphans of the Storm, is now being shown. Mr. Griffith is fearful of the rampant reformer and of well organized and aggressive minorities. "We should be on guard against the minority tyrant--the 'think as I think, do as I do, eat as I eat and drink as I drink' individual," said the producer in his speech, "for this man will bring upon our country turmoil quicker than any other. There is only one law which amounts to anything, the law of human feeling; the law of love for one another. You cannot make people good by law. We are turning out repressive laws very fast nowadays and the result is we are developing a marked disrespect for law. Unless checked we might become a people without any regard for law at all." Mr. Griffith was a luncheon guest of Mayor Schwab at the Lafayette at noon and was a dinner guest of friends in the evening. "Prohibition is causing a lot of dissatisfaction in this country," he declared. "People of little or no means feel that their well-to-do neighbors are enabled to secure liquor simply because they have the price, and this makes for class feeling. If there is widespread disrespect for land and bad feeling between classes, a revolution may result. He said he knew little personally of conditions in Hollywood, Cal, and that he had not been there in three years. "Since reading in the newspapers of the latest scandal there," he continued, "I have read of three preachers who went wrong, but it doesn't follow that all preachers should be ostracized. In every calling there are people who are good and there are others who are rotten, and this applies to the motion picture business. In any event, the motion picture industry is too big and too essential to be killed by the acts of a few irresponsible persons." Mr. Griffith paid his respects also to reformers as a group. "Men don't become reformers until they are 50 years old," he said. "Then they expect youth to be governed according to the infirmities of age. It isn't fair. "My people wanted me to become a minister, and they gave me the training, but I strayed from the path. All the other members of the family grew up to be pious, and one of my sisters never set foot in a theater until she was 35 years old, and then it was to see a picture which I had produced."
