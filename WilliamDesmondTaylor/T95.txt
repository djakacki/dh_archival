January 27, 1917 MOTOGRAPHY The Directors' Association of Los Angeles, which numbers among its members most of the big directors in the country, was formed by four men who just talked it over one evening and brought it into being--William D. Taylor, now with the Fox company, Alan Curtis, the Universal comedy director, Joseph De Grasse of the Universal and Murdock MacQuarrie, actor and director. The concern is now a national affair and nearly every director of note is affiliated. It is doing a lot of quiet good and is self-protective rather than aggressive. Taylor, Curtis, De Grasse and MacQuarrie have every reason to be proud of their first little talk.

June 1, 1918 Charles Giblyn EXHIBITOR'S TRADE REVIEW

History of Motion Picture Directors' Association

The Motion Picture Directors' Association was founded in February, 1915, in Hollywood, Cal. That this beautiful foothill annexation to Los Angeles should have been the birthplace of our organization was quite in the order of things, for this delightful little city has won its spurs as the center of the motion picture industry. The need of co-ordination among directors who at that time were producing pictures made itself felt in many ways. So many directors were totally unknown to each other; the idea of fellowship was extinct; the unwritten "black list" influence of the "stormy days" of the industry still made itself felt in covert bigotry and selfishness. It was recognized as "part of the game" for directors of rival companies to place as many obstacles as possible in the way of others. The old "locations" often were battlefields, and the alleged "strategy" resorted to was as expensive as it was asinine. One firm went so far as to spread broadcast the statement that it had the exclusive right to photograph all the Spanish Missions in the State of California. But we found, upon investigation, that the "padres" in the various missions were always willing to extend the privilege of "take de movee" for a liberal contribution to the poor box. And the same "padres" were not at all slow in getting wise to the "easy money," and the amount advanced each time the "location" was required. Another company, whose studio faced the ocean, repeatedly "bluffed" competing directors into believing that they had no right to take pictures of a rocky formation that had, by the hand of the Creator, been placed advantageously for pictures, and which was part of the shore acres forming part of the United States Government land! But incidents of this character are too numerous to dwell upon, having since passed into the discard. Envy and malice caused a wave of slander to bring the entire motion picture population of the West Coast to a sudden awakening a few years ago. The studios were referred to as "camps," "cesspools," "habitats of criminals and vagrants," etc. It was charged that the reputation of a woman or girl was at stake if she accepted employment there. That this pernicious outbreak was the result of pure fabrication and a desire for revenge was a matter that the district attorney quickly discovered after setting an investigation on foot. After weeks of inquiry, it was found that a minister had opened the attack. Briefly stated, he was compelled to admit that a girl had a friend who knew a girl who "wanted to get into the movies." And another girl told her that it was "a terrible place." The minister's informant was forced to admit that she had never seen the inside of a motion picture studio. The incident caused a serious stir for some time, but according as the FACTS became public, the clamor died away. However, as always is the case, the scar remained. I find myself forced to allude to this near-scandal for a very necessary purpose. While the District Attorney still was deep in his investigation, in one studio, where twenty or more directors were engaged, an indignation meeting was held. Then and there it was decided that an organization of directors was necessary. We alone in one studio could not take it upon ourselves to fight these calumnies for the entire directors' colony. A meeting was called, and the exact hour arranged, and everything came off precisely as we planned, except-- We had forgotten to talk the matter over with the weather man. The director in whose home we were to meet lived snugly on a promontory up to which a single road led, and in the deluge of rain that came down the road was of little use to automobiles or pedestrians. It was just one of those southern California rains. It was a "bird." My automobile started on the 1,500-foot climb in fair shape, and was behaving well in the dark, when a chap coming down fumbled his car about in a mussy fashion, and in passing me ripped into my right fender by way of salutation and was off. Far down below we got a splendid view of the lights of Hollywood. A few feet off the path and my car would have toppled down among those lights. Yea--a fine night! Out of twenty odd directors, NINE took a chance with that southern California rain. Those nine men formed the M. P. D. A. then and there. A week later thirty directors attended the meeting. And thus it grew. After several meetings, in the following May, we became an incorporated body. One year and a half later, in November, 1917, the motion picture directors in the vicinity of New York City were called to a meeting held in the Hotel Astor, for the purpose of forming a branch of the M. P. D. A. When its aims were laid before these directors the corner-stone of the New York lodge was placed in position. They moved with greater rapidity than had the original body, for the reason they had fewer obstacles to overcome. After a second preliminary meeting a lodge of motion picture directors was opened in Carnegie Hall, where several members were initiated. The charter came along in good time, and today we have our own building in West 55th Street, near Broadway. The M. P. D. A. is neither a labor union nor essentially a social club. It is a fraternal order. Its ritual makes it impossible for the idea of coercion, or other methods employed by labor unions, to enter into a question when its members are concerned. That stormy night in 1915 was a memorable night for the M. P. D. A. The roster today shows more than 150 members. When one considers the number of directors in the industry, this showing is truly commendable. The association's board of censors see to it that an applicant for membership qualifies after rigid tests, and these rapidly are becoming more difficult. The field of desirables soon will be exhausted. Death has claimed three of our members thus far this year, and with the world war brought to our very door, several others now are in the service of the Government.

March 24, 1917 MOTION PICTURE NEWS What promises to be the most successful year in the history of the Motion Picture Producers' [sic] Association began Thursday evening of this week at the first monthly dinner of the organization, held at the private dining rooms of the Los Angeles Athletic Club. The dinner was the first step toward carrying out the new plan adopted at a recent meeting of the organization, and at this the officers recently elected president for the first time, William D. Taylor, president, was toastmaster. In his introductory remarks he outlined the general policy of the association, pointing out that the erroneous impression had been gained by many that the association was formed for the purpose of boosting salaries. This he stated was not the case, as the directors had bound themselves together thinking association and discussion of methods of production would be beneficial to each and every member, and therefore to the industry as a whole. In closing his remarks he introduced Lois Weber, the only woman member of the association, who was the guest of honor at the dinner. Miss Weber's remarks were of a very happy nature and appreciation, for the many kindness shown her by members of the association. Miss Weber pointed out the need of a press committee for the association and outlined the work such a committee could accomplish for the association in working with the trade journals.

November 27, 1919 Florence Lawrence LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Can you imagine swinging the girl on the corner to the flaring syncopated notes of the "jazz" orchestra? Can you picture such celebrities of the world as Bessie Barriscale, May Allison, and the rest in the "allemand left" or the Charley Chaplins and Douglas Fairbanks of the cinematic kingdom doing a grand right and left while the moaning saxophone, the rattles, and the whirring drums keep feet and pulses beating a lively tattoo to the busy music? Those are just a few of the remarkable dance features of the Motion Picture Directors' ball which was held last night with tremendous success at the Hotel Alexandria. Practically the entire hotel served as a "location" over which camera queens and megaphone emperors ruled with undisputed sway. Dancing in the ball room provided a panoramic whirl of the most noted figures in the celluloid world, and the novel and clever programs, devised, I believe, by Victor Schertzinger, will long be prized. They were in the form of a scenario, and showed the "fade in," the "flash-back," and when it came to "memories of old days," the entire crowd formed into groups for the old fashioned contra dances and tripped it merrily in quadrille and Virginia reel. Elaborate decorations of flowers and palms transformed the rooms into veritable bowers of beauty, and both the mezzanine floor where the dancing was in order and the Indian Grill where supper was served from 11 to 1 were constantly filled with the leaders of the film world. Two orchestras kept lilting music for the dancers, while the famous Hawaiian orchestra supplied the melodies in the supper room. Among the stars present were Mme. Alla Nazimova, Viola Dana, Clara Williams, Pauline Frederick, Wanda Hawley, Madeline Travers and Louise Glaum. The ball committees were under the supervision of Director Charles A. Giblyn and Past Directors Otis Turner and William Desmond Taylor. The committee of arrangements included Joseph de Grasse, chairman, and Reginald Barker, Wallace Worsley, Frank Lloyd, Walter Edwards, George Melford, Frank Beal, William Beaudine and Murdock McQuarrie. The reception committee were James Gordon, chairman; Norval MacGregor and Thomas Ricketts. Musical arrangements were under the care of Victor L. Schertzinger. The officers of the Motion Picture Directors' Association of America are: Charles Giblyn, director; Walter Edwards, assistant director; Frank Lloyd, technical director; James Gordon, secretary; Norval MacGregor, treasurer; Fred Kelsey, inner guard; Victor Herbert, outer guard, Board of trustees: Reginald Barker, chairman, and Joseph de Grasse, Thomas Ricketts, Ben F. Wilson, William Duncan, Frank Beal.

September 1, 1920 LOS ANGELES HERALD Members of the M. P. D. A. (Motion Picture Directors' Association) are going ahead speedily with their plans for a dance to be staged at the Alexandria on Sept. 16, the proceeds of which are to go to disabled soldiers now in Southern California. At a meeting last night the association appointed an entertainment committee and some of the prominent directors who will serve are: William D. Taylor, John Ince, Joe De Grasse, Frank Lloyd and Phillips Smalley. Each studio will contribute its quota to the program. Already Sennett's, Arbuckle's, Universal and Ince have agreed. Doraldina will do her famous Hawaiian dance, and, if this is any incentive to ticket buyers, this is said to be the season when grass is scarce. Wallie Reid will send his jazz orchestra and be on deck himself. The cause is a worthy one and the M. P. D. A. is to be warmly congratulated for interceding in behalf of the crippled veterans.

December 1920 PHOTOPLAY Ten thousand dollars was raised for the Disabled Soldiers of the Great War at a ball given in September at the Alexandria in Los Angeles by the Motion Picture Directors' Association. The affair was exceedingly gorgeous in the appointment and entertainment and the 700 people who gathered represented the elite of Los Angeles society as well as of the Hollywood film colony. William D. Taylor, feature director for Realart, was in charge of the entertainment, and presented some unique stunts. Doraldina did her fascinating hula-hula; Tom Mix and twenty of his cowboys in full regalia pulled a fake hold-up and separated the crowd from its spare cash; Larry Semon paid $500 for a bat and ball autographed by Babe Ruth, and Ben Hampton gave a like amount for a pair of crutches belonging to one of the wounded heroes present--and then returned the crutches. Over in one corner was a booth marked "For Men Only" at a dollar a man, which caused a good deal of excitement, but rumor hath it that it was a blank. Among those who graced the dance and the wonderful supper served at midnight were Wanda Hawley, Jeanie MacPherson, Ruth Roland, Lois Wilson, Mr. and Mrs. Conrad Nagel, Mary Miles Minter, who entertained a party of twelve, Tony Moreno with a number of society people from Beverly Hills, Pauline Frederick and her mother, Bebe Daniels, Mr. and Mrs. Tom Forman, Elliott Dexter, Mr. and Mrs. Wally Reid, Mr. and Mrs. Charlie Eyton (Kathlyn Williams), Irene Rich, Margaret Loomis, King Vidor and his wife, Florence Vidor, May Allison, Viola Dana, Colleen Moore, Mr. and Mrs. Jack Holt, Priscilla Dean and Wheeler Oakman, Mr. and Mrs. Willard Louis, Mary Alden, and William Duncan and Edith Johnson.

January 24, 1922 HOLLYWOOD CITIZEN Welcoming comparison of American motion pictures with foreign-made productions, but expressing a desire to protect thousands of American workers from what they believe to be retrenchment policies of domestic producers, the Motion Picture Directors' Association, through its director-president, William D. Taylor, has wired the Senate Finance Committee, urging that imports of foreign films be either limited in quantity or taxed on value, with volume and cost of film production in the United States, as a basis. In the telegram sent by Mr. Taylor it is stated that motion pictures are being produced abroad far cheaper than they can be made here, and that producers are now establishing units for making affiliations abroad and are drastically cutting down domestic production. The eleven months ending May, 1921, compared with the previous twelvemonth, he asserts, show an increase of 36 percent in imports of exposed film negative and a decrease of 26 percent in exports. "Members of this association would deplore exceedingly, a situation wherein domestic producers would find it economically profitable to make pictures in Europe at lessened production costs and bring them to the United States for cutting, editing, and distribution ostensibly as American products," declares the director-president of the directors' association. There is now being prepared by the Senate finance committee a Fordney tariff bill, which imposes 30 percent ad valorem duty on foreign-made motion pictures imported into this country. The present national association of producers and distributors, it is said, is opposing the 30 percent tariff, fearing retaliation by foreign nations. They argue, it is reported, then American manufacturers would have to produce abroad, to enter the European market on a basis equal to their foreign competitors. This, they allege, would throw American actors, directors, workmen, artisans and laborers out of employment. On the other hand, it is stated that the actors favor a 60 percent duty based on American valuation, and through the Actors' Equity Association charge the producers with desiring a low duty in order to take advantage of cheap labor and materials in producing films abroad for use in this country. The motion picture-directors are said to favor limiting imported negative (exposed) to a designated percentage of domestic film production, this percentage to be divided among foreign countries in proportion to their respective volumes of film production. As an alternative measure, they suggest a heavy protective tariff based on production cost in the United States at the time of entry.

MR. WILLIAM D. TAYLOR: Brothers: it is a great pleasure to see so many of us here this evening. We are all directors. Very few of us are going to be much more than directors. We don't have an opportunity to get out and realize just what this industry means. We are more or less getting into a rut and we have an opportunity tonight to hear from a gentleman who has been thirteen years in this business, associated with the General Film Company and at one time their general manager in New York, the organizer of the Paramount program, a man who, ten years ago, wrote an article outlining just exactly what has been since that time, forecasting the multi-reel picture, the raise in prices from five, ten, twenty, twenty-five, up to what they are today; a man with a vision and a man who undoubtedly will help us a lot. I take great pleasure in introducing Mr. W. W. Hodkinson. (Applause)

MR. HODKINSON: Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Motion Picture Industry: Your president, Mr. Taylor, wrote a letter to me inviting me to come here tonight to speak to you on the subject that is nearest to my heart, and I think we are going to get on common ground very quickly, because I think the thing that is nearest to my heart is nearest to your heart; it is the possibilities and future of this great industry with which we are connected. It is a very great industry--greater with all of its possibilities than any of us can realize who are close up against our work seven days in the week--and sometimes nights. It is an industry, Gentlemen, that some day will govern the greatest brains in the world, because it is that kind of an industry. It is more than an industry. It is the most potent force that has ever been let loose on this earth for the helping onward or the retarding of the human race. This industry will command the best brains of the world for this reason. It offers the two rewards that brains have always demanded for themselves-- a medium for the expression of an idea and the financial return for the idea. The wonderful part of the motion picture is that you don't have to speculate as to the influence of your idea. We know that there are volumes in the library but we don't know how many people are reading them. Nor do you know how many people understand your language--but here we have a common language. We have something where the very financial returns will let you check up and find to what extent your ideas "got across." We must either go along with the progress of the business or we must get out of the way of the brains who will come in and go along with the progress of the business, which will help its progress. I believe that the industry is at this minute facing two conditions which will make it necessary for us who wish to go along and make progress to take stock. I think that the business needs co-ordination. It must be better co-ordinated. I think if it is better co-ordinated most of the problems that confront it can be handled. You know all of the discussion that is going on at the present time, relative to sex movies, reformers, blue laws, censorship, etc. There is nothing new about this agitation. It has been a rising wave. Any student of conditions could see it coming for some time; and the industry must meet this condition more intelligently than it has shown any disposition to at the time I left New York, to keep from being engulfed. I am not going into details in this matter except to say that in your position you are in the most strategic position to help this situation--and it is a real danger and it is a real menace. I believe there must be some co-ordinated effort on the part of those responsible for the putting of these things before the public in addition to your effort. I will briefly tell you something that I noticed as I came across the country which will show you why we are going to be hurt by this condition, and then I will pass on and afterwards if you want to go into this particular subject further by questioning me I would be glad to give you my impressions. The problem is that we are getting so many kinds of censorship prepared for us in different communities that unless we stop opposition to us that is making this condition possible, there will be so many police powers exercised, so many drastic censorships, that it won't pay to make any type of picture because you are not sure it will go into this state or that state. Today it is possible to have pictures on the shelf that will not go to Kansas, that will not go to Pennsylvania and to Ohio. Going through Oregon the other day I brought with me copies of three bills that were before the legislature that day that would effectively close the motion picture business as an industry so far as that state is concerned. One required only special performances for children, boys up to 16 and girls up to 18. Another was that no picture showing any act of crime or violence of any sort would be permitted. Now we know that is radical, we know it is the work of fanatics in that instance. But, Gentlemen, if you were to see as I did the method with which the local exhibitors and motion picture powers were endeavoring to combat this you would be disgusted. Passing on from this moral crisis, which present announcements and present plans of the producers may or may not meet effectively, I don't see much progress made because last night I had a bulletin sent me from New York that is being put out by the reformers in which they quote at great length what Mr. Brady, representing all the motion picture producers said to Mr. Cohen, representing all the motion picture exhibitors. Each of them admits everything that everybody has charged against the industry but blames the other for it. Hence the necessity for some co-ordination in curing this fundamental wrong otherwise we will have a state of civil war between the producer on one side and the exhibitor on the other. There is also an economic side concerning this industry. I could give you a lot of figures as to the volume of business taken from the public and in turn paid for films and the expense of distributing these films. But unless you co-ordinate them and get the significance out of them--out of broad experience in that line--probably they would not be of any value to you, so I will not get you to figure any more than I have. As some of you may know, I am frequently on record as opposed to producers' control of this industry. I don't know whether you know that I am on record to that effect. I don't know whether you know what I mean by that. I don't know whether you think that I mean anything by it, but I assure you that I do. I will endeavor to make clear just what I do mean by it and just what the great fundamental fault in this business is, and unless it is cured it will make you and me and every individual in this industry who wants to go along on the basis of individual merit incapable of utilizing our strength to get out of a situation which will destroy us if we cannot utilize our individual strength. I believe the theory of the producer of a motion picture having the power to control the distribution of that picture is wrong. I do not say this because I want to be a middle man who gets in between a producer of a picture and gets a commission or a percentage that belongs to the producer because I helped pass them to the exhibitor. That isn't primarily the thing I am after. It is necessary to do that to get money to support the organization machinery necessary to properly co-ordinate these two functions of production and exhibition; and if you put this distribution channel into the hands of either, you can create, as far as I am able to see, an abnormal and impossible condition. Now, let me illustrate more clearly just what I mean by that. You know we have today some fifteen national distributing organizations. Almost without exception the distributing companies are adjuncts of producing companies. We hear about the great waste in the studios--and I presume there is great waste in the studios--but I want to tell you some waste that probably you do not know about. Through being improperly co-ordinated, or not co- ordinated, this business is only taking one-half of the revenue from the public every year that it could take if it was co-ordinated. Through not being properly co-ordinated the producers are producing twice as many pictures today as is necessary to fill all of the theaters in the United States. I can tell you how many millions are wasted there. Worse than that-- or because of the first condition of a lack of patronage from the public, an excess production of [....] [A page of the transcript is missing.] ...obliged that I have been able to go on this far. Did you ever stop to think what it means when the fifteen are each trying to undo the work of the other fourteen all of the time? That is what is happening in this business. Did you ever stop to think how far this business can progress when we have to create tremendous machines with all of the politics that goes with them because we have to meet release dates and it takes a certain number of pictures to keep one of those machines going? That is, it takes a certain amount of product out of a production machine to keep a distributing machine going. There is room for lots of thought on this matter. I have given it a great deal of thought. If what I say is true, then we are beating ourselves out of half of the revenue that this business might have from the public if we knew what we were doing--if that is true it is quite a startling fact. If it is true that the industry has been producing twice as many pictures as it needs to get the present revenue to support the theaters, on the present basis of revenue, and to keep the same revenue at least immediately coming from the exhibitor and from the public--that is startling if it is true. If we are spending twenty million dollars a year to support these distributing machines when you could do the job much better with ten or less--that is startling if it is true. If the total sum spent in production and running these machines is greater than is taken out of the exhibitor--that is another thing that is startling if it is true--and I believe it is true. If these uneconomic conditions exist they exist for one reason: the desire of each person in the business to play his own game, regardless of what happens to the business as a whole. This is a business, gentlemen, where people have been taking out, taking out, and nobody has been putting in; and we have got to same stage in the business we would get to if we did the same thing with grain. When we exhaust it we have to plant before we get another crop. I believe we are at the stage where we have to do some planting in this business--more intelligent planting--and it has got to begin at the top, gentlemen. You can't think of all these things while you are busy producing the picture. It has got to begin at the top, and there must be some architects and planners who will formulate some plan for securing these conditions--and then cure them. Producer control, I think, is a vicious thing. It puts the producer in an impossible position. If I thought it could be done I would be a producer with a production organization and a distributing organization. I don't think it can be done. I don't think I can do it. I know all these other executives that are trying to do it--I know them quite well. I don't see any of them that I think can do it. For the simple reason that when we get the balance of power by which we can force a thing which he happens to make into a market, whether it is fit for that or not, how are we going to be guided as to whether we are progressing or whether we are slipping--when we are confronted with a lot of people who are on our payroll, who are telling us how fine it is all the time. I don't know. How are we going to know the capacity of all these people? We have to supply the money, to hire the directors, and so forth, and carry on the systems all the way down the line. I don't know. I don't know. Probably I am mistaken--and when I think I am mistaken I go back to the proposition of the producer-controlled distributing organization. Films that don't run in first run stations, don't run out in the country--which is the proof that I am not wrong in this viewpoint. Why do not these producers who are requested to put out so many pictures that they have to make them poorly in many instances to meet release dates, and who have to have their men traveling on the same train with some other men to sell products, or going in to unsell the product the other fellow has sold--why don't they cut down their product and why don't they consolidate their distribution? It is because they don't trust the others. It is because no producer would want to put his product through another producer's machine. He would rather carry along some organization which he calls assets when they are liabilities; and the longer he carries them, and the greater liabilities they are, the less anxious he is to go to the banker and tell him that is the condition. So much for the production part of it with the producer control. We have the exhibitor on the other side who feels that under this producer control he is charged all the producer can get out of him regardless of whether it is right or not. Without saying whether the exhibitor pays too much or too little, the undignified conditions, gentlemen, on which motion pictures are sold is a disgrace to this business. The way they start and ask $5,000 and take $250--it doesn't build any confidence; it doesn't inspire any respect in the mind of the exhibitor or the men who work selling the pictures. We have got to have more scientific and better ways of determining values. It is possible to determine the value of pictures. Some years ago all pictures were ten cents a foot, and I went into New York and submitted a proposition to change that. I knew when I was trying to buy a producer's picture as cheaply as I could that when he sold them to me he was trying to make them as cheaply as he could to get the margin of profit out of them. But that was regarded as foolish then, as maybe it is foolish today--when I say we should get some better means of selling the pictures than we have today. But when I devised a percentage system whereby a producer owned his own product and had a life interest in it, progress began from that time on because the producer had a stake, he had an incentive. The exhibitor today has no confidence in the people who supply him with films. He organizes, buys all the theaters in the town and tells you what he will give you. It is civil war. It is, as I say now, a condition where Mr. Cohen is telling you that Mr. Brady, the Representative of the National Association, who, because he is a fine speech maker, is telling the exhibitors that things are all right whether they are all right. They are all right, I presume, so far as Mr. Brady knows. He is telling them they are all right and the exhibitor is retorting by saying "We dealt with your National Association and you went back on your agreement; you broke your promises." Gentlemen, do you think that a great, big, dignified--what should be a dignified--industry like this, which gives us such a field for talent and brains is going to go along standing all of this mistreatment? It is not. It is not. It is either going to cave in and close up or it is going to get in some hands that will run it properly, I'll bet you. I walked away from the biggest thing in this business and staked my personal fortune, every dollar, three years ago, against the written advice of my attorney and my former associates, that this condition would whip itself--and it is doing it very properly and very promptly at present. My function today: I am trying to help some worthy element on either side of this proposition to co-ordinate and function, and if we can help the rest to see the same thing and guide them and shape them--fine! There is no patent on anything that I think. I am telling you what I found in a back lot in 1917 when I came back and said "What shall we do with the motion picture industry?" and told of this civil war that is happening now--between Mr. Brady and Mr. Cohen and I was predicting and showing that it had to lead inevitably to that. It is very hard to want to do things for an industry for a lot of people in that industry and to be misunderstood. If you gentlemen here are producers I am not interested in getting in-between you and your market after a commission. I am interested in getting you that hundred percent increase in revenue you are missing now, and getting mine out of that. I don't want any of your commissions. Gentlemen, I am forcing into the exhibitor in conferences with him, individually and collectively, across this country, these facts--and the fact is that I have a mechanism. It is a fine theory that these things are all wrong, but what are you going to do to better them? I have got a mechanism that can be used with the exhibitor on one hand--because I don't put myself in a relationship with a producer where I have to be dishonest with the exhibitor--and furthermore I want to put myself in a relationship with the exhibitors where I can be honest and fair with the producer who deals with me. If that doesn't solve the thing as far as we are concerned, if that isn't the type of adjustment that must come into the industry, then I will say that I have wasted thirteen years in which I have studied this thing as carefully as any student ever studied an engineering problem--I have wasted these years and will take off my coat and go to work for the fellow who has the plan that will straighten this thing out. I think that right now the producer-controlled organizations are beginning to disintegrate. I think that within a very short time, instead of the factory system of production, we will have individual units of production on their own; on their own merits--sinking or swimming on their merits, not carrying anything and not being carried. All I want is an opportunity to keep on trying to beat a system that is carrying a lot of surplus, excess weight, whether it is wasteful, duplicating system, or whether it is excess capitalization, or any of these factors. I can put that money they are wasting in the hands of the people who have confidence enough to go along on the basis of their individual merit. I haven't any rough and ready rule as to what makes an efficient production unit. I don't know. The director says to me "It is the director." Somebody else says: "It is the producer" and somebody else says: "Why, I am the author: I wrote it" and somebody else says something else. I think, as a matter of fact, that we are going to get good product from various concerns under varying schemes and varying systems. I think there are going to be men who are competent to do the production thing straight through and I think there are others who are going to need to be supplemented. I think [....] [A page of the transcript is missing.] MR. HODKINSON: The best answer to that, Mr. Taylor, is to say that the saloon was quite a success financially until the reformer used the excesses to smoke the public out in the open, and say "do you want them or do you not?" And lots of people who patronized the saloons said "We do not." And there are lots of people who go to sex pictures, who if the reformers brought it to an issue would say "we do not want them." It is true that these pictures are successful--commercially successful. It is true, however, that that is not the whole story. An exhibitor frequently has a 'flash in the pan' of sensational business and undermines a clean family business that gradually falls away from him and he cannot hold his sex business because after they get it all they can't take any more of it. They go as far as they can and they can't go any farther, and if you are going on with that you have to go all the way through. MR. EDWARD SLOMAN: "Is there any way the director, himself can help?" MR. HODKINSON: I believe so, Mr. Sloman. I believe that you gentlemen, if you grasp the significance of this, if you realize the parts that you are playing in making these elements up and serving them out to millions of the public--shaping their minds and their thoughts--if you take yourselves seriously to that extent and realize that your influence is more potent than that of the school teacher or the educator in any other branch, and fight that in your individual way. Fight for certain standards of cleanliness and decency in this business that you want preserved in your home and in society generally, the standards that you would want followed in the theaters if your children were going to the theaters. I think that if you protest--perhaps you have no more right to do anything more than to point out to the man who hands the story to you. That is wrong. I do not believe in that, and in many instances--the majority of instances--I believe that the men who are dependent on you, even if you are under signed contract or agreement, have a right to your sincere opinion and I think you can point it out to them that it is a poor business risk for them to do it and that it is a poor business risk for them to ask you to do it. I think you are very powerful if you take this thing seriously and realize what a wonderful position you gentlemen are in today. MR. TAYLOR: "Where would you draw the line, Mr. Hodkinson? Some of these states and community censorship propositions are so impossible that it would absolutely stop the making of pictures." MR. HODKINSON: That is true, but just as the pendulum swings one way it has to swing back. There is no way we can keep from paying the penalty for our past sins. I could go into my files in New York and show you a letter that I wrote to Mr. Lasky in 1915 or 1916 on this same matter. I said "By all means, Mr. Lasky, we should not be forbidden the privilege of showing life in all of its phases. But it is when we take an incident, repulsive and gruesome, and distort it, it is when we take a sensational incident and build it instead of letting it run along the regular way, when we build it up to a peak and emphasize it and 24-sheet it, that is where we get away." A MEMBER: "What did Mr. Lasky say?" MR. HODKINSON: I wouldn't like to quote Mr. Lasky without having my correspondence present, but I wrote him at the time "The Cheat" was put out. At the time "The Cheat" was put out, it made a great success on the Paramount program and at that time I was President of Paramount--and all the time I was watching this thing we are talking about tonight. Sensational sex pictures were just coming out. We were very careful to see that we didn't give any out, so far as Paramount was concerned. I suppose "The Cheat" would be very tame today but I saw the handwriting and I wrote several pages to Mr. Lasky telling him the same thing, Gentlemen, that I am telling you tonight. You have got to pay in trouble in living this thing down for all the gains you have. No use bothering about it. We just have to wait through it, that is all. We have got to re-establish confidence where we have lost it. I don't know, maybe we can have an overnight conversion and get ourselves adjusted around to seeing things in their proper perspective. I doubt it. I find there are very few in any walk of life, who if the responsibility isn't put directly at their door, go out of the road to worry about the ultimate responsibility. Occasionally a damned fool comes along, like I did in this business thirteen years ago, when they all said it was a nickel thing, and I said "I don't believe it." I kicked along and I ran a theater and in order to run the theater successfully I had to figure some way of getting better pictures. The only way I could conceive was to select out of the nickel product all the better pictures and make an admission charge of ten cents. I had to figure out some way of getting better pictures. I got the best 14 years ago. I tried it out and it worked. I went to another locality and did the same thing. I commenced to think the fellows were wrong. And then I tried it. I got control of the distribution. I worked in as an experiment and I have been experimenting ever since. I don't give a damn whether I go out tomorrow. You know? Nobody owns me. Nobody's got anything on me, "no strings." (Applause) Running a house of prostitution is one extreme of getting money by catering to certain instincts in a human being. Writing a sweet, delicate little story, such as the best of people lives in their lives, is another end of that same thing. You can go so far without offending the dignity of the public. From one of these extremes to the other you can go so far and then you must stop. When you go to getting people into a theatre by a title which suggests that you are going too far, then you get an unfavorable reaction. You build up a desire on the part of these people who are just as abnormal one way as other people are another. It seems to be a law of nature, you know, that she balances. MR. HUGH RYAN CONWAY: "Don't you think, Mr. Hodkinson, the very thing that draws the majority of people in to see a picture such as the title--the very thing that reacts against pictures within that man's own family--the morbid curiosity or the 'sex appeal' thing. The fellow says, 'I will drop in and see that,' but doesn't want his family to see it. He sees the picture and sees the title. After he sees that he is very careful after that what his family sees. He doesn't say, 'Go down and see a picture.'" MR. HODKINSON: I will tell you an instance that shows you an angle of this same thing. I happened to ride in a train with the wife of the president of an exhibitors league on my way out there. It chanced that she got on the same train. We were discussing pictures, and I asked her about her husband's show and she didn't seem to know so very much about it. And I asked her if she had children, and she said, "Yes," and she volunteered the information that a lot of pictures her husband had shown she would not let her children see, and I said, "How about other folks' children?" and she said, "Well, that is their livelihood; that's the way we make a living;" she just hadn't thought about it. A MEMBER: "If censorship regulation made conditions so that it would be impossible for an exhibitor to make any money because nobody would go in to see the picture wouldn't the public say, 'Open up the theatres; we want our pictures again'?" MR. HODKINSON: A few years ago they were saying the working man wouldn't stand for his glass of beer being taken away, but where is it? You see, there is nothing in this world, Gentlemen, that really counts except intelligence; and if you get more intelligence on the side combating pictures than you have on the side defending pictures, your pictures are going to be whipped. If you have got more intelligence on the side of defending pictures than you have in opposing pictures, you will whip the other side. A MEMBER: "Do you think national legislation will stop the sensational pictures?" MR. HODKINSON: Theoretically, yes. Theoretically. Before we had so much political scandal as a result of the war, I saw this thing shaping up all the time and I wanted to see the power in the hands of high grade people to regulate this thing, and I would like to see it today, Gentlemen, but I am afraid it would get into politics, bribery, corruption, etc. Theoretically, I would like to see decent, responsible family men handling this--men with the same feeling of responsibility towards the public and the industry-- regulating that. But frankly, before anything else, I would have the industry know that it is right inside and have it delegate to some one the authority to speak for it, and whip these people who are responsible, and who, I believe, are willing to call of their dogs when we can convince them that we are in earnest. A MEMBER: "If the producer and the exhibitor cannot get together and meet on some common ground, what happens then?" MR. HODKINSON: Well, the producer recognizes the weakness of his position to a great extent. In order to bolster up his position he is taking over theatres, but he is getting himself in an awful jam in taking over theatres. He is finding himself in a position where he has to reject some of his own product, his own pictures, because he cannot loose $5000 in the box office, when he only gets $1000 for his film. Yet he asks exhibitors to do that. (Laughter) I can tell you names, dates and places where I am renting pictures to the producer-exhibitor, who shelves his own pictures. (Laughter) A MEMBER: "Don't they control the industry? Don't the exhibitors control the producers? MR. HODKINSON: In a section, in a town, in a locality, but not completely. Gentlemen, if I get better pictures than anybody else you can't keep those pictures from the public...
