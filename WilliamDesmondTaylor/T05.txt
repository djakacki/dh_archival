***************************************************************************** The Connette Episode

Shortly after Taylor's murder, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford took a business trip to New York. At every stop along the way they encountered reporters asking their reactions to the Taylor case. One newspaper reported: 'All this talk about Hollywood is a joke, anyway,' Doug said. 'Why, say, do you know there was a prominent minister and--oh, me--oh, my--a prominent newspaper editor seen hiding around the Taylor house just before the murder? They're expected to be arrested at any minute. Strait stuff! This is the real inside story of Hollywood.' Doug winked. [1] Doug was, of course, joking. But within a few months a former newspaper editor would indeed find himself the center of suspicion in the Taylor case. Honore Connette was telegraph editor of the LOS ANGELES TIMES until June of 1920 when he went to work for the LONG BEACH PRESS, where he remained until January 1922. On January 11, Connette's mother died. He began drinking heavily and became addicted to Veronal, a barbiturate. He left Los Angeles the day after Taylor was murdered, and sailed from San Francisco on February 7, bound for Honolulu aboard the Sonoma. While the ship was anchored at quarantine outside Honolulu he approached the waterfront reporter for the HONOLULU ADVERTISER with many questions about the Taylor mystery. He asked if anything new had developed since the liner left San Francisco. He took the reporter to a corner of the deck to ask his questions and finally said, after looking around, in a quiet voice: "I'll tell you one thing, that was not a woman case. You can be sure of that." He was asked what he meant by this and said that he had been a newspaper man a long time, and knew lots of people in the "movie village," and had reached that conclusion. The HONOLULU ADVERTISER reporter then consulted the local Chief of Detectives, informing him what Connette had said. The detective took down in his notebook details of Connette's name, his occupation and the questions which he had put to the reporter. After the boat docked Connette applied for a job on the Honolulu newspapers, but was turned down. He went to Hilo, where he was hired by the HILO TRIBUNE. On March 14, that newspaper published an article written by Connette suggesting that Taylor's killer was hiding in Hilo. Connette also wrote '...that the slaying was of the vendetta type, and that the man who did the killing did so from a revenge motive. I believe that at some time in Taylor's life he may have wronged some one and that this person or possibly some near relative, a brother or father maybe, settled the account.' Connette's article also expressed the firm belief that Sands was innocent. On April 25, 1922, the following statement was issued by Harry Irwin, Attorney General of Hawaii: The matter was called to my attention when I was in Hilo recently at a conference held between the governor, Mr. Green and Mr. Stevenson of the HILO TRIBUNE, and myself. They reported that from the time of Connette's arrival at Hilo he seemed to be very much interested in the Taylor murder case and it formed the chief subject of his conversation during the whole time he was here. Mr. Greene and Mr. Stevenson soon became impressed with his interest in the case and began to observe more accurately his actions and his statements. Connette, upon his arrival at Hilo, made a statement to Mr. Greene to the effect that in his opinion it would be easy for the person who murdered Taylor to come to Hawaii, lay low for awhile until the excitement died down, and then skip out to the orient. He had obtained a passport to the orient before leaving Honolulu for Hilo. One night in the office of the HILO TRIBUNE he described in detail to Mr. Greene the way in which Taylor was murdered. He also described details which were subsequently shown to be substantiated at the time, but which were not published in newspaper accounts of the Taylor murder. Connette seemed to be worried about the whereabouts of one Gareth Hughes. Finally one day one of the police officers of Hilo found in the street a partially written letter which was addressed to Hughes. It was shown that the letter was written on TRIBUNE bond paper and undoubtedly written by Connette. Connette later stated to Mr. Greene that 'everything was all right now' because of the fact that Hughes had gotten into Mexico and was then in a place called Ensenada, and that he could not be extradited because of the fact that the Obregon government had not been recognized by the United States. This information was all transmitted by the attorney general's department by letter and wire to Mr. Woolwine, the Los Angeles district attorney, who requested the attorney general's office obtain a statement in detail from Connette. This request was forwarded by the attorney general's department to Hilo by wire and the reply came the same day to the effect that Connette was leaving that day for Honolulu by the steamer Maui. The attorney general, with the aid of Detective Captain McDuffie and members of the detective force, then attempted to locate Connette in Honolulu. On his arrival in Honolulu from Hilo he left his trunk on the wharf and went away with a handbag. Every effort was made to locate him, but without success. It was found that he had purchased a ticket for San Francisco on the steamer Maui. He evidently went aboard the Maui a few moments before that vessel sailed for the coast. His acquaintances here, as far as the office of the attorney general is able to ascertain, saw nothing of him during that time. The fact that he was on his way to San Francisco was wired to District Attorney Woolwine in Los Angeles. Subsequent to this, the attorney general's office received a wire message from Attorney Woolwine stating that Hughes had appeared in his office, made a full explanation of his whereabouts, and had been freed from any suspicion as to being connected with the Taylor murder. [2] The letter supposedly written by Connette was typewritten and not signed. It read: My Dear Gareth, This may possibly be the last letter you will have from me, and so I will be quite frank and clear things up so you will understand when the crash comes. I expected to be well out of this mess before this and my previous letters have led you to believe that everything was clear sailing. I did not want to worry you. What I did back there I have never regretted. Always remember that I acted to an impression stronger than faith or this thing they call religion. As I told you in the house at San Jose, I believe in the Mosaic law: 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' I cleared on your score. I did what any brother would have done if he had any red British blood in him. I thought we could get away with it all. On the ship was a man who kept trying to make friends with me. You know I was ill with the worry of it all, but I had reasons enough not to meet this man's advances, for something warned me. You know the old superstition of our country, the thing that comes like a shadow and tells of approaching death. [3] When Connette arrived in San Francisco on the Maui he was taken into custody by L.A.P.D. Detective Sergeant Jesse Winn. Among Connette's effects was found a .38 calibre revolver with one shot fired. Winn took a long statement from Connette and escorted him back to Los Angeles where he was held in jail as a "material witness." Meanwhile, back on Hilo, the HILO POST-HERALD reported: According to his associates while in Hilo, Connette, during periods of being under the influence of either liquor or drugs made statements that would give his hearers the impression that he was connected in the famous Los Angeles mystery. On one occasion he gave a vivid pantomime of the murder to one of the members of the house where he was stopping. Going through the action of Taylor bending over a table signing his income tax return and showing how the murderer stepped out of the closet, steadying his revolver on a table and firing the fatal shot that sent Taylor to his death. Again taking up the role of the murdered man, he showed how the stricken man staggered and fell, indicating the place where he dropped the fountain pen he was using and other small details. At another time after receiving a letter from the mainland he stated to another member of the household, 'Well, I don't care what happens now, the boy has reached a country where the United States has no treaty, they will never catch him now.' On another occasion he said to the same party, 'Well, I suppose I may as well go back and face it, like a man. I can never escape anyway and it won't make any difference as I won't live long anyway.' Connette kept a loaded, cocked thirty-eight revolver in his rooms at all times and sometimes carried it on his person. When asked why he had the revolver cocked, he replied, 'Oh some day I may want to commit suicide and I don't want to change my mind while I am cocking the gun.' [4] After this story appeared in print the reporter who wrote it was taken into custody by the Hilo Sheriff Department and questioned for several hours regarding his sources of information. Then several other people were summoned to verify his statements. Back in Los Angeles, Connette stated, "I never saw the letter until it was shown to me by Sergeant Winn. The letter was apparently built upon things I said in a moment of levity in the presence of a newspaper rival in Hilo. I know absolutely nothing about the Taylor murder other than the facts that are common knowledge. A newcomer in Hilo is a target for either fair or unfair treatment and I stirred up considerable animosity owing to newspaper rivalry there. I suppose I drank a bit and said things while under the influence of liquor upon which the preposterous situation in which I now find myself, could have been built. Another motive on the part of the newspaper rival in making the charges, is the fact that he desired to return to California. He thought if I were held for trial on the charge of killing Taylor, he would secure free transportation as a witness." Connette did admit once working in one of Taylor's films as an extra, and having a casual conversation with Taylor about a book. When Connette's explanation was relayed to his acquaintances, back in Hilo, he was not believed. They stated Connette had no known enemies in the newspaper profession and several people living in the boarding house where he made his home also heard him make incriminating statements on the Taylor case. He had described the murder in detail on several occasions and stated that he witnessed it from a point in Taylor's study. Hilo Sheriff Sam Pua sent a cable to Woolwine stating: "Important evidence is in my possession concerning H. C. Connette. The evidence includes a signed statement in which Connette declared he killed a man a short time ago in defense of his honor. He also gave a description of Taylor's room at the time of the killing." In Los Angeles, Connette denied he ever killed anyone. He was taken to the Taylor residence and paraded before Faith MacLean; she said he did not resemble the man she saw leaving Taylor's home the night he was killed. Connette was then taken to a Turkish bathhouse on Fourth Street, reportedly a hang-out for drug addicts. He stated he had been there on the night of the murder, registered under the name of Donald MacDonald. The name was found in the registry and several attendants stated they remembered him being there on that night. Actor Gareth Hughes was summoned to police headquarters, questioned again and released. Connette was also released. The District Attorney's office stated that no charges had been placed against Connette or Hughes and that none would be. On April 29, THE HILO TRIBUNE headline blared: CONNETTE CASE TO BE HUSHED UP BY WOOLWINE On that note, the Connette episode faded from public view.
***************************************************************************** Deposition by Leslie Henry

Extracts from deposition by Leslie B. Henry, given July 11, 1933:

A: (By Leslie B. Henry) Some time within a month or two of Mrs. Shelby leaving, I think it was along in March or April, 1926, Mrs. Shelby called me and asked me to come to the house; that a situation had developed that was of a very serious nature, and to please not fail to come.

Q: (By Mr. Schwartz) Did you go?

A: I did.

Q: What was your conversation, if you had one?

A: To the best of my recollection, Mrs. Shelby told me that District Attorney Keyes was on his way to New York in connection with the Taylor murder case, and that she was convinced that Mary -- She told me that Mary would probably lie about her, and wanted to know what she should do under the circumstances. I asked Mrs. Shelby, had she talked to Mr. Mott about it, and she told me that she had not talked to Mott, and told me that, "A friend of mine on the Examiner" had given her the information.

Q: A friend of yours?

A: I mean a friend of hers. I told Mrs. Shelby I saw nothing that could be done about it until Mr. Keyes' return. She was in a hysterical state -- I cannot describe it. She told me, "This will kill me." I told Mrs. Shelby, "You haven't anything to fear in this. You need feel no sense of guilt." She said, "I don't know what Mary will tell him." And whether it was just that conversation or a series -- I don't know. This thing occupied weeks in there.

Q: You mean you had a number of conversations on the subject?

A: Yes. I had conversation after conversation with Mrs. Shelby about this particular incident, and it became absolutely critical -- well, Mrs. Shelby told me, "I can't wait for this thing. I have got to get out, and get out now." I told Mrs. Shelby that if there was any information got out that Keyes had gone to New York for the purpose of making an investigation of this matter, that for her to make a move at that particular time would probably to be caught, and put in an absolutely impossible position, so far as the Taylor case and other matters were concerned. The matter got into the newspapers.

Q: Did you see articles appearing in the newspapers at that time?

A: I did.

Q: Did you discuss any of those articles with Mrs. Shelby?

A: On the appearance of any article that had any new development in that case Mrs. Shelby would call me and have me come to the house to talk with her regarding the new phases of it.

Q: Will you go ahead and give us your best recollection of the conversations you had in the series of talks, when you say you went out there frequently, when the matter was under discussion?

A: The question of the passport, and the citizenship and everything came very much to the front in connection with this. I am trying to segregate them. I can only tell this, that Mrs. Shelby called me to her house many times during the period I believe of I think it was March, April and May -- it was right near the time of sailing, in connection with, as I said, new developments in the case. Mrs. Shelby would call me and tell me, "The papers called up today and asked me" such and such a question, and among other things they asked her whether she was a crack shot with a revolver, and whether she had a revolver in the house, and Mrs. Shelby said, "The only revolver that ever was in the house as far as I know was one that Mary one time tried to get to shoot me."

Q: Shoot whom?

A: Mrs. Shelby. She on some of these occasions asked me -- on all occasions, asked me how she was going to stop this situation from the papers, particularly just before Mr. Keyes got back, and I told her on each occasion, "Mrs. Shelby, you are going to have to wait until the District Attorney is here." She told me she had talked with Mr. Mott, and Mr. Mott had told her the same thing. I talked with Mr. Mott, and Mr. Mott said the same thing. "There is not a thing that can be done on this until Mr. Keyes is here, and we can talk to him." I said to Mrs. Shelby on one occasion, "You are perfectly convinced that you can tell a connected and witnessed story of what you were doing on that night?" She told me -- I can't repeat it, but it was exactly the same story she told me right after the Taylor murder, of what she had done that night. I said, "I can't see why you should continue to worry about it." She was just distraught upon each of those occasions. I said, "Put faith in your own innocence in the situation." She said, "I don't know what that girl will tell Keyes." I told her that after all there was nothing she could tell Keyes that must not be subjected to investigation and study and search. She said, "All Mary is doing is trying to ruin me, in addition to the financial situation." Mrs. Shelby said, "And after all she may be lying for herself." I said, "You don't mean, Mrs. Shelby, that Mary had anything to do with that?" And she said, "She may have been damned fool enough to have done it." Incidentally there was a similar remark made after the actual death of Taylor. In trying to relieve her of fear I told her, "You have just got to stand on your own consciousness of your innocence, and the nature of the story that you have told me, and if it will stand up the district attorney will do nothing to you." When Mr. Keyes returned --

Q: Did you have any further conversation with Mrs. Shelby on this same subject after Mr. Keyes returned?

A: Yes, I did.

Q: At the same place?

A: Yes.

Q: Will you give us the conversation? First did Mrs. Shelby, if you know, remain in the city during this period of time, or did she go out of the city at any time?

A: During this period of February until June, 1926, I was going to tell you that I am trying to place the time --

Q: (by Mr. Lewinson) That is not a complete answer. Trying to place the time, of what?

A: Oh, I had not answered the question. No, she did not remain in the city.

Q: (Mr. Schwartz) Do you know where she went?

A: Mrs. Shelby told me when Keyes was expected here, and that she was not going to stay here and be indicted for the murder of Taylor. That she was going to get out then. And I told Mrs. Shelby, "If you leave under these circumstances it will be quite possible in my estimation for you to be indicted. If ever there was a time when you should be on the ground, this is it, at this time." She told me that to follow that kind of advice would be just to "Sit here and not only be indicted but probably find myself confronted with framed testimony." She said, "I can show legitimate reasons for leaving the city. They can't indict me on the score of a departure, because if either you or Mr. Mott get any inquiry you can tell them I am away on business relating to my mother's affairs, my mother's estate. Mrs. Shelby told me she was having absolutely no contact with the newspapers, and hid herself away from any association with anybody.

Q: You mean this was in a conversation?

A: Yes, and Mrs. Shelby told me, "I am going to get out of here, and whatever has to come through you or through Mr. Mott it can be stated that I am out of the city in connection with my mother's affairs." To the best of my knowledge Mrs. Shelby -- She told me that she was going down to Louisiana, and that in the small towns there it would not be possible for anybody to locate her.

Q: Do you know how long she remained away?

A: I don't remember whether it was several or three weeks. I cannot tell you.

Q: Did you see her when she came back?

A: I did.

Q: Did you have any conversations with her?

A: Yes.

Q: On this same subject matter in connection with the death of Taylor?

A: Yes.

Q: Go ahead and give us your best recollection of any conversations she had in the period before she left for Europe.

A: After I returned there was a constant rehash of this same situation, of apprehension, not knowing what was going to happen, and she told me that Mr. Mott assured her that if the matter had not been taken up with the grand jury it was not going to result, in his estimation, in any action at that time. That Keyes was apparently not prepared to go ahead with it. Mrs. Shelby told me that Mr. Mott told her that Keyes had, I believe, told him that he had insufficient evidence, despite what he had learned in New York, to bring an indictment without further investigation. Mrs. Shelby told me, "I am going to demand that the district attorney's office make a statement exonerating me in this and call this thing off now, or it will surely be reopened again, and it may stop me from going abroad, or bring me back when it would be to my greatest embarrassment." I asked her how she was going to get that kind of a statement. She said, "I have demanded of Mott that he talk with Keyes and get that kind of a statement from him." She said, "Don't you think I should be exonerated?" And I said, "Unquestionably. If there is any possible way of getting you clear on this thing I would surely leave no stone unturned in order to get it." She asked me if I knew Keyes, and I told her that I did not. But I told her that I knew a deputy in the district attorney's office, Fitts, and she said, "Can't you talk to him and see whether he can -- You tell Fitts what kind of a man I am" -- beg pardon, "what kind of a woman I am, and let him carry that word to his superior." I told her I would do that if Mott was unsuccessful with Keyes. Mrs. Shelby told me that she felt very certain that Mr. Mott could get that kind of a statement from Mr. Keyes. I asked her whether Mr. Mott had given her that kind of an assurance, and she said she was confident that by reason of Mr. Mott's position in the community that he could obtain such a statement. I told Mrs. Shelby that I could not believe that Mr. Mott had made any such assurance to her, because I could not conceive of the district attorney coming out with a public statement, or even a secret signed letter to her exonerating her of a crime, especially in a situation where they evidently were all at sea, where new developments might at some future time make the district attorney appear in an absolutely impossible position. I told her that seeing Mr. Fitts was just about as purposeless, and that I would be very much surprised if Keyes signed any such statement. I cannot differentiate these conversations. Mrs. Shelby told me on more than one occasion after that, in conversations at her home, that she had not been able to get anything out of Mott. That Mott had not gotten this statement which he had promised to try to get for her. And finally, I believe it was within a month of the time she sailed, she told me that Mott had told her that Keyes would not sign such a statement, and she told me, "Without that exoneration I cannot stay in this country safely. You must speed up everything for me to get away from here before something happens." That was about the substance of those conversations at that time.

Q: Did you have conversations with her in New York on that same subject?

A: That was in New York, when that came up. I am trying to place --

Q: (by Mr. Lewinson) Mr. Schwartz, I don't understand whether that question has been answered yes or no, whether he had conversations in New York?

Q: (by Mr. Schwartz) He said yes. Did you answer, Yes?

A: Yes.

Q: You say you are trying to place when and where it occurred?

A: Yes, whether in the express office, or coming away from the express office -- I don't remember.

Q: Was there anyone present besides the two of you?

A: I don't remember whether Barbara was with me or not. I cannot really place Barbara in that picture. Mrs. Shelby asked me, did I think that she could be caught before she left on the boat, by a warrant from the district attorney's office in connection with the Taylor murder case. She said, "I seem to have gotten by the Government as far as my passport is concerned, but can the district attorney at Los Angeles pick me up here in New York on a warrant for my arrest?"

Q: On a "warrant for my arrest?"

A: Yes. I told her that I did not think a warrant could be issued against her unless she had been indicted, or a complaint had been filed, and it had been very evident before she left Los Angeles, from information Mr. Mott had given her, and from what Mr. Mott had told me, and that I told her, that they were not going to take any chances on indicting Mrs. Shelby without better evidence than they had, or they would have done it when they came back from New York. She said, "They might do it, if it is found out in Los Angeles that I am out of the city with this property, because no action can be taken by Mr. O'Melveny against me here. Mr. O'Melveny might use the district attorney's office to stop me in some way." I told her I though that was ridiculous, and not to worry herself in the few hours before she was to sail, over a matter of that kind. One of the last things she asked me in New York was, "Can they extradite me in Europe without indicting me?" I told her I was certain they could not. She said, "Well, I can't get caught off-guard," and I told her if there was any indictment developed in the case that I was certain that Mr. Mott would have early acquaintance with it, and that while he would on discovery that she was in Europe be very, very angry over having been left in a somewhat embarrassing position of he as her attorney not having been informed of her departure; that I though Mr. Mott would be the first one to be informed as to anyone that could reach her, telling her of any danger of that nature, and that it would probably be in the newspapers, and certainly there would be speedy enough information to inform her, so that before the service of a warrant, or any extradition proceedings she would know what her situation was. She told me, "Well, they will have to find me if you or Margaret get word to me that an indictment has come." I told her to forget the indictment. That was about the substance of the talk.

Wild Hollywood Parties: Fact or Fiction?

March 12, 1922 CHATTANOOGA TIMES (Chattanooga)--Declaring that he had recently been in Hollywood and other points in Southern California, and was thus informed of conditions there, evangelist John Brown told his congregation of women that what little they may have read of the degradation and vice existing in the motion picture colonies had but touched at the edges of things as they are. One hundred of the leading actresses have organized as the "Nude 100," he said, and the fetes of the organization could not have been surpassed in wicked Sodom and Gomorrah of old.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 13, 1922 Lindsay Denison NEW YORK EVENING WORLD (Los Angeles)--There was a "party" which was raided by the police though nothing came of the raid. After a commonplace entertainment remarkable only for stupid vulgarity, "refreshments were served." But the servants had not food and drink on their trays--they had hypodermic needles, papers of "snow" and opium layouts. There was a "pill cooking contest" between noted headliners. It was at this point that the police broke in. The host broke out at the same moment and a few minutes later appeared at his front door in his palatial car, demanding to know "what had been going on his absence."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 Edward Doherty NEW YORK NEWS (Los Angeles)--William Desmond Taylor would have been a Patrician had he lived in Rome when it was at its greatest and wickedest. Taylor's ghost might boast to the other ghosts of having been at better parties than any that they had seen. He might tell them, for instance, that little tale told by an humble Jap. [5] The Jap served as valet to half a dozen stars; was butler at a number of houses. Let him, for the story's sake, relate his tale in English. It was the Jap's first time in the mansion--the home of one of the most beautiful and famous actresses in the world. "They asked me serve the dinner for them last night. I was delighted when they asked me. I said to myself, 'I will really see this angel-like creature, this woman that has filled my life with beauty.' I was exhalted. I tread reverently in that house. "The guests came, two by two, man and wife, in great automobiles. They came in laughing, full of happiness. I had seen them all. The greatest stars in the world! "A dozen of them there were. And how I admired them! "One of them sang while the dinner was getting ready; one of them played the piano. Then one of them danced. I peeked through the door, which I held open just a little--so. The dinner was ready. The guests sat down at the table. Such silverware! Such wonderful linen! Such great heaps of food! Lamps were burning everywhere, and there were many flowers. "I served the cocktails. I brought on the courses. I brought on wine and highballs, and green drinks, and yellow, and orange, and purple drinks. "I was bringing in the coffee service on a cart when the big man threw a plate of food at me. He hit me with it. He hit me in the face. The gravies trickled down my vest and on to the rug--the rug worth thousands of dollars. "They thought it fun. They shouted. Men commenced to throw things at the women. The women threw things at the men. "Soon the food was flying all over the room. Costly china plates were smashed against the walls. Statues were thrown down and broken, pictures were ruined. Flowers were strewn everywhere, mashed under heels. "They got up, drunk, most of them. They threw whisky and wine at each other. One man poured a bottle of champagne down the front of a sweet little girl's neck and the language she used! Never have I heard such words! "The victrola was turned on; the big man yanked the tablecloth from the table and put it on him and gave a war whoop like the Indians, and danced around, making gestures that were nasty. "Everybody followed him. They yelled. They whooped. They threw chairs at mirrors. One man, very graceful he was, turned cartwheels, and his feet struck a woman and knocked her down. She put her arms around him and kissed him and bathed his hair with half a tumbler full of whisky. "Then the big man jumped on the table and pulled open his shirt and exposed his stomach. He held his stomach with his big left hand, and with the other he plunged a hypodermic needle into it. [6] It sickened me, but everybody laughed. " 'This is the life!' he shouted, and jumped down and took a lady in his arms and went into another room. She was not the lady he came in with. Everybody left the room too, with everybody else's wife, except the lady that owned the house; and she laughed, and told me to get busy and clean up the place." Perhaps the ghost of the murdered Taylor may come back to the scene of these old revels and visit with the blades that still hold orgies in the palaces of Hollywood.

The guests got down on all fours and proceeded to conduct themselves each as he conceived the animal he was imitating would act in his native jungle or sty. As the festivities became "jazzed up" the terrific noises and the squeals and screams of some of the women, who didn't like the playful tricks of the human wild beasts, caused quieter members of the community to violate their usual reticence and call the police. The Chief of Police undertook the errand himself. The noise died down for a time; about daylight it became so outrageous again that a committee of scandalized outsiders gathered at the front door. They were just in time to meet the Chief of Police coming out, hatless, with his hair tousled, blood running from a torn ear and with an "extra" girl hanging unconscious in his arms. He declared he was "the original Borneo organ-outang returning to the jungle with the fairest of the villagers."

He had supplied the opium for the members of this cult, all men, of which, he says, Taylor was a member. He declares the men would lie in silk kimonos, smoke the essence of the poppy flower and so commence their ritual, old as Sodom. The Chinese asserted that the members of the cult were held together by a bond, unthinkable, unnameable, unbelievable, and that each had sworn an oath of undying affection for the others. He believes the jealousy of one of these degenerate cultists may have caused him to slay the movie man.

This modern Gomorrah is known the world over as Hollywood, and, according to population imagination, its streets are lined with dance-halls, cabarets, magnificent gambling joints and opium dens, the denizens of the film colony working but one or two temperamental hours a day, devoting the other twenty-three to delicious sin. Movie queens, in inlaid limousines, roll through the golden avenues to meet wicked directors intent upon their happy ruin, bathing parties nightly plunge into tanks of eau-de-cologne, while beautiful "snow birds" attend cocaine parties at which the Japanese servants administer drugs from silver needles; while every morning the police, seizing the blonde curls of your beautiful film favorite, drag her from some subterranean hop-joint. [7] One eastern paper goes so far as to say that "the needle-hounds of Hollywood order their drugs over the telephone like groceries." [8] No, puzzled reader, these tales of "love cults" and "dope rings" are just good old newspaper hokum. The only real evidence I can offer in the use of narcotics is the hectic nonsense emanating from the drugged sconces of the newspaper fellows, who have been looking at Hollywood through dope rings of their own blowing.

Writer Answers Screen Defense of Soiled Nest

"How can there be men and women writers anywhere on earth base enough to invent any or all of the lurid stories that have been printed so generally about Hollywood and the film people?" The question was asked in an article by Frank Woods, president of the Screen Writers' Guild of the Authors' League of America, and Thompson Buchanan, chairman of the Writers Club, which was printed in the CHICAGO TRIBUNE of March 1 and in other papers throughout the country. The article, a defense of Hollywood and the film people, is in reality an attack upon Wallace Smith of the CHICAGO EVENING AMERICAN and myself--and Mr. Woods and Mr. Buchanan mentioned our names, branding us as liars, fakers, slanderers, dealers in scandal. Mr. Smith and I have been warned repeatedly that gangs of men employed in the studios have sworn to "get us." [9] We have been called "space writers," representatives of the "scurrilous eastern press," and it has been intimated that we are users of drugs ourselves--we who complain that a few movie actors ease their worries with a sniff or a shot in the arm. But the movie people who have threatened violence have taken the more prudent method. They have not come near us. They have left the matter to their writing men-- and these have attacked us in the newspapers. I should not have replied to these articles had the TRIBUNE, for which I write, not printed the Woods-Buchanan article. The TRIBUNE printed it because the TRIBUNE believes in fair play. Had there not been a reference to Mr. Smith and myself I should not have challenged a single statement of these two Hollywood writers. In the first place let me explain that neither Wallace Smith nor Edward Doherty is a space writer. [10] Both of us, writing space, could have made thousands of dollars; neither of us made a cent. We wrote what we pleased, spending extra hours to send it, merely because we were assigned to the story and felt it our duty to tell the world about Hollywood. Not a line of what we wrote was faked. Not a story was invented; not one article that either of us wrote contained a single thing that was untrue. [11] Both of us know that if we did print anything untrue there would be libel suits. There have been many articles in which we were referred to as liars and slanderers--but no libel suit has been started; and we do not believe one will be started. I live in Hollywood. I have lived there since last October. I have a year's lease on a house. I intend to go on living in Hollywood. I know Hollywood, and I know my neighbors. Wallace Smith has lived in the Ambassador Hotel since last November, but he knows Hollywood, too. He has frequently visited it in the company of actors and actresses. He has been to some of the Hollywood parties which-- according to Messrs. Woods and Buchanan--never occurred. It may be an interesting sidelight to record the fact that I, a conscienceless liar, a slanderous scandal monger, a reporter who has told so many untruths about Hollywood, should be offered the opportunity of becoming the chief publicity man for "Fatty" Roscoe Arbuckle--and that I should reject the offer as soon as it was made. I covered the Arbuckle story on three occasions in San Francisco. I had excellent opportunities for "faking," as the Woods-Buchanan combination calls it. But it appears I sadly neglected it--and the offer to become Arbuckle's publicity man came from one of Arbuckle's attorneys, a man who has read everything I have written, including my articles on Hollywood. "Hollywood is angry," said this lawyer. "The truth stings." I feel rather proud of this. The Woods-Buchanan article intimates that I sided with the district attorney against Arbuckle. I sided with nobody. I never do. I tell the facts as accurately as I can get them. I feel with the Screen Writers in this--that Arbuckle is innocent of the death of Virginia Rappe. "Arbuckle's mode of living," they said, "which was too often the same as that of thousands of young men of other stations in life, who, like him, have too much money, was nevertheless indefensible, and, somehow, someway, the impression was conveyed that he was a fair example of the film folks' depravity." That's what the Screen Writers said. I wouldn't have said that. Strange to say, I believe Arbuckle one of the cleanest of all moving picture actors. I didn't think so--but the conviction was drilled into me through watching him in his three ordeals and to listening to the evidence against him. "This quiet and beautiful section of Los Angeles has been treated to a drenching of slander unequaled in American journalism," the defenders say, "while film people themselves have been pictured largely as drug addicts, drunkards, profligates, and degenerates. If a half or a quarter or even a tenth of this muckraking is founded on fact then the people engaged in making motion pictures, particularly the stars, are of the wrong class and ought to be eliminated." True, and the "muckraking" is founded on a talk with a member of the state board of pharmacy, who has control of the drug addicts of Los Angeles and who has registered not a few moving picture stars and lesser lights with deputy sheriffs; with decent men and women picture players; with the local reporters, who wish they could print what they know; with the records in the police blotters. Neither Smith nor I was born yesterday. We have been in many cities in the United States and Mexico. Both of us have become more or less accustomed to looking on the seamy side of life--and both of us were amazed at the conditions that exist in the land of the movies. We were incredulous at first. We investigated. We found out the truth. And at the earliest opportunity, without consulting each other, we began to tell it. I regret to say that we were not the first to tell of what is going on in Hollywood--I do not say was going on, but is going on. Theodore Dreiser told some plain, blunt, ugly facts about directors and extra girls and other incidents in SHADOWLAND, a moving picture magazine. [12] I have not heard that either Mr. Woods or Mr. Buchanan called Mr. Dreiser a liar or a faker or a muckraker or even a space writer. Let's sum up the rest of the article briefly: "Work in pictures is exacting and mentally and physically exhausting--so much so that a great majority of the active workers have no time, strength, nor inclination for the revelries and orgies which have been pictured as the rule rather than the exception." But there is a minority that does find the time. We did not say the majority was rotten. We do say the minority is. "The camera is relentless, and no actor or actress, especially the younger ones whose faces are literally their fortunes, can remain long in the spotlight and at the same time give way to any sort of self-indulgence." Correct. There are a lot of favorites, still young, still beautiful, who no longer dare the camera's scrutiny. There are others who will be "removed" very soon. It is understood that Adolph Zukor came to the coast recently to get rid of one of the most prominent male stars in the world--who has been using a hypodermic needle. [13] "Taylor, himself, who had been a man of exemplary habits, fine deportment, and high ideals, turned out to have had an adventurous past. He had taken a stage name, like many others of theatrical profession, and this was made much of." He had a woman's nightgown in his home. He was attended by persons of no character. He was an intimate of several women, had deserted his wife and child. He took a couple of stage names. There are other accusations against him. One could go on indefinitely. The article complains that reporters said certain movie people questioned by the officials were "grilled." Smith and Doherty said they were not grilled, but should have been--and we repeat it. After telling how Smith and Doherty "seized on the Taylor mystery as an excuse for digging up and rehashing all the dead scandals of the picture people that had accumulated in the last ten years" the article admits "there were only a bare half dozen of them," adding, "but they were embellished, added to, and enlarged until they read like juicy stuff." Here's confirmation right out of the screen people themselves. We not only dug up a lot of dead scandals which were news because they had not been printed before--but we also told a lot of new ones. A writer in New York [14] tells how the film folk there recognized the persons talked about, even though in the first place the stories were untrue, and the characters, thinly disguised. This writer, after denying everything we wrote, added very naively, that we must have paid "some one on the inside" very well for our information. Then there is reference to an "alleged interview with a Jap butler--pure fiction." It was I who told the Jap butler's story. I don't know whether the story was true, however. I could not verify it. So I told it, as it came to me and quoted the Jap butler for what he was worth--nothing more. There are more ridiculous articles being printed by the Screen Writers than two reporters can reply to. They are all of the same type, denying the stories written by us, calling us fakers, picturing us as "trampling the daisies under foot" and proving nothing. However, as Smith has told, the biggest hotel in Los Angeles has given its waiters order to "sap over the head" any actor who "sniffs a nail full of snow, or mixes a drink, or makes a rough crack in the dining room."

***************************************************************************** William Desmond Taylor

February 12, 1922 Jane Dixon NEW YORK TELEGRAM Fate is Seen in Tragic End of Filmdom's "Love Pirate" It's a man's game--that of love pirate. The man plays, and plays--and PAYS. A potent, pulsing personality; a magnetism dangerous as it is compelling; a heart attuned to the voices of many women; a quick wit; a ready tongue; an adventuring that brooks no interference, moral nor material; a mad, reckless whirl through the shining hour of sun; and at the end--the leaden period of death. William Desmond Taylor, dabbler in dreams. Ink is scarce dry on the cancelled mortgage the powers of evil held against his life. So, out of the rainbow past, the long, long past reaches the arm of expiation, pointing a merciless finger toward the hour of earthly reckoning. There is no escaping that finger. Ignore it if you dare. Defy it. Beat upon it with a will to destroy it. Still it points, and will point, until the ardent adventurer comes into his travail, until expiation has been done. Filmdom welcomed William Desmond Taylor, gave him a seat among the mighty, hearkened to his word, moved at his command. Its men looked and admired. Its women looked--and loved. What richer sea could a love pirate sail? A list of the girls, the women, taken aboard the love pirate's ship of dreams for a brief cruise on the sea of pleasure would read like a slightly deleted directory of the screen's feminine stars. There is another directory, too, made up of the names of lesser planets, simple little extra girls who left the safe harbor of their homes to seek fortune in the world of make-believe. To them the great man behind the megaphone was a god whose favor was to be sought at any cost. Now, if we may believe rumor, the sated appetite of the love pirate called for stronger stimulants than a conquest of hearts. One report has him a member of a cult with an unmanly ritual. Another speaks boldly of drugs-- opium, cocaine, Lethian fogs of forgetfulness, ending in wild orgies, during which women, in jealous frenzies, tore the clothes from each other's bodies and, stripped to the waist, fought like tigers for the favor of the pirate ship captain. Once, at least, since he has been privileged to gather blossoms willy- nilly in the glamorous garden of love, the pirate has eaten of his own dead sea fruit. His chauffeur tells how, after a New Year's eve party in the fashionable Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, he was so unhappy over an altercation with his companion [15] of the evening that he broke down and wept. The bitterness of unrequited love seems to have been his portion in this particular case. He was reaping the whirlwind of his own sowing. Who sped on its horrid way the leaden pellet which brought the eventful story of the love pirate's life to a tragic close? Was it one of the fair ships he had scuttled? Was it another pirate vessel, jealous of a rival's plunder? Was it a legitimate craft, the captain of which could not endure the depredations of the modern Captain Kidd? Was it a derelict, its crew gone mad from dipping into a contraband cargo of drugs? Was it a phantom ship sailing out of the past to drive the pirate from the seas? Of only one fact we are sure--that William Deane-Tanner, alias William Desmond Taylor, could no longer escape the moving finger of Fate. He had made a bargain. The hour was at hand when he must pay--in silent expiation. Destiny, as is just, has taken her toll.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 7, 1922 LOUISVILLE TIMES Fire Burn and Cauldron Bubble The movie owner and the movie director have been the men of amours since the flying camera shutter first began to click. Handsome though he be, the leading man has had hard sledding. Now and then a beautiful lady would fall to his portion; and, of course, he had his share of bathing beauties and roadhouse party-fodder; but the Guineveres, the Elaines, the Cleopatras and the Columbines have worn the tag of owner and director. These form the higher circle of the fast life on the Camera Coast, and thus the new tragedy in Hollywood is interesting to the public because it deals almost wholly with stars. Poor Fatty Arbuckle was the only luminary in his case because he is an actor and has only limited favors to bestow. But Taylor was a director in the first degree: desirable parts and large salaries went to whom he said they should go. He had a bijou flat in a bijou row, and it was appointed as a garconniere [17] should be. After the megaphonics of the day the Great Director would retire to this little nest and to him would repair some lady artist to have a quiet nip and to discuss the burning subject of art. The more the Great Director appreciated the qualities of these artists, the greater their opportunities and the larger their salaries. The persistence on the screen of many vulgar and awkward women in star roles proves how much a director can do to make life profitable and pleasing, and his favor is even more important than an owner's. So if he has a little flat and is hospitable to ladies, what more delightful than to visit him as his butler is leaving and clink a refreshing cocktail? Nearly all the lady artists have a "mother" or an "aunt" abiding with them who are so confident of the virtue of their charges that they are lenient with them; and these duennas can arise in time of stress to vow that Maisie was only a causal friend and is a good girl who never had a temperature of over 98.5 in all her life. Taylor, being unusually well-placed to extend favors to lady artists, and being a dashing fellow withal was popular with the fair and received a number of visitors, for whom an inventory of his effects reveals that he furnished every modern convenience. In many other bijou flats on other bijou rows other directors have been in equal favor, and all in Hollywood was as merry, if not as regular, as a marriage bell. But the smiles of women bring the frowns of men, and a man who roves with too many sometimes gets in trouble with one. So one night last week the director accompanied his last fair visitor to the limousine. There came murder and mystery into Hollywood and into the lurid columns devoted to the tragedy came names that were not commercially benefited by it. And the mystery endures, and the blood cries out for vengeance, and before the two are quieted there will be a deal of uneasiness, and shattered feet of clay will be strewn about the fallen images of several golden girls. It is inevitable. The ingredients of scandal and immorality and tragedy are generously found in movie colonies. Never before in the history of the world have so many women, depending mainly on their beauty, been vying for place and favor from men. Place and favor in the movies have all too frequently gone for a fundamental price eagerly given, cynically received. (Continued next issue)
