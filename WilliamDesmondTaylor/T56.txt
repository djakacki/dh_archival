TAYLOROLOGY is a newsletter focusing on the life and death of William Desmond Taylor, a top Paramount film director in early Hollywood who was shot to death on February 1, 1922. His unsolved murder was one of Hollywood's major scandals. This newsletter will deal with: (a) The facts of Taylor's life; (b) The facts and rumors of Taylor's murder; (c) The impact of the Taylor murder on Hollywood and the nation; (d) Taylor's associates and the Hollywood silent film industry in which Taylor worked. Primary emphasis will be given toward reprinting, referencing and analyzing source material, and sifting it for accuracy.**********************************************************************************************************************************************************Taylor/Minter Film Available on Home VideoAt long last, a film directed by William Desmond Taylor and starring Mary Miles Minter is available on home video. "Nurse Marjorie" (1920) is now available from Grapevine Video, P.O. Box 46161, Phoenix, AZ 85063, phone (602) 973-3661. This film is interesting because of who the director is, and because of the substantial footage of Mary Miles Minter. Anyone with a deep interest in the Taylor murder case will want to own this video. Many silent films hold up well and are still very entertaining today. Unfortunately, "Nurse Marjorie" is not one of those films. The story is extremely stupid (see the contemporary reviews in TAYLOROLOGY 24), but the film does have a few humorous moments, and Mary Miles Minter looks appealing. In the film, Minter's father is played by Arthur Hoyt, who was one of Taylor's close friends. By a strange coincidence there is a scene in the film where Minter's beloved has been shot. She wants to rush to his home, but her mother tries to prevent her from going.**********************************************************************************************************************************************************Reporting the Taylor Murder: Day OneWilliam Desmond Taylor was shot to death at approximately 7:50 p.m. on February 1, 1922. His body was discovered at about 7:30 a.m. on the morning of February 2. The following are press reports published in the first 24 hours after the body was discovered, excluding eulogies and recaps of Taylor's film career. Some of the original press reports are now lost; each Los Angeles newspaper had many editions that day, but only one edition survives in library microfilm. So out-of-town newspapers have also been utilized, to recapture as much as possible of that first day's reporting. Some commentary at the end attempts to correct some misinformation. In general, the reporting in the LOS ANGELES TIMES appears to have been the most accurate, although it too contains some misinformation.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 2, 1922 DESERET NEWS Movie Director Shot and Killed at Los AngelesLos Angeles, Feb. 2--William D. Taylor, director in chief for one of the largest film companies operating here and nationally known in the motion picture industry was found dead at his home here today under circumstances that the police say indicated murder. He had been shot through the neck. After the first investigation, it was thought he had suffered a hemorrhage but closer examination disclosed the bullet wound. The body was found near a desk in Taylor's room, upon which there was a canceled check. The wound, according to the police, indicated that it was fired from behind Taylor by some person who was standing up, while Taylor, apparently, was seated before the desk, examining the check. The bullet went through the neck, ranging downward, and penetrating the heart. Several months ago Taylor informed the police that he had discharged a butler for making irregular use of Taylor's bank checking account, and police are conducting an inquiry along these lines seeking a possible motive for the slaying. An actress living in an adjoining residence informed the police that she saw a man go into the apartment of Taylor early today, and shortly afterward heard a shot. The body was found by Taylor's valet. Police say that robbery evidently was not a motive for the slaying for a purse containing $78 was found on the desk near the body. There were no indications that any attempt was made to take any articles or papers from the room.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 2, 1922 LOS ANGELES RECORD New clues were discovered late this afternoon that may lead to a solution of the mysterious murder of William Desmond Taylor, 35, noted movie director, found shot through the back, in his apartment, 404-B South Alvarado street, this morning. New developments were:1. Taylor had a premonition that death was near, and related his fear to Mrs. J. M. Berger, income tax expert. "If anything happens," he told her yesterday afternoon, "look out for my affairs."2. Mysterious phone calls and anonymous letters were received by Taylor. He told Mrs. Berger that for three weeks someone had been attempting to find out if Taylor was in his apartment. When Taylor answered, the person would hang up immediately.3. Taylor was engaged in a telephone call that evidently worried him, when Mabel Normand called at his apartments at 7:15 p.m. yesterday.4. Taylor is reported to have told Charles Maigne, a friend, that he feared unknown persons, who invaded his apartments while he was absent, walked on his bed with dusty shoes, and left gold-tipped cigarette stubs. Detectives late today said they were unable to find a single trace of Edward F. Sands, former valet of Taylor's charged with robbing Taylor. Warrants were issued weeks ago for Sands. Police want to question him. Mabel Normand, this afternoon, was confined to her home from nervous breakdown. She is said to be a dear friend of Taylor. Taylor's body was found sprawled in front of his writing desk, by Harry [sic] Peavey, colored man-servant. He was evidently shot from behind. The bullet took an upward course, entering his body near the left kidney. Powder burns were evident. The bullet lodged underneath the right shoulder. Death was instantaneous. Mabel Normand, the motion picture star, is believed to have been the last person to see Taylor alive. Officers say that she had discussed a scenario with the Famous Players-Lasky director early last evening before the colored valet had left, and that Taylor had conducted her to a waiting auto in the street. Peavey, the valet, who left the house at about the same time, said that Taylor had left the front door of the apartment open, and it is assumed that the murderer entered and concealed himself, shooting down his victim as he returned. Peavey discovered Taylor's body, lying as it fell, with a chair athwart the legs, and rushed in a frenzy of fear to rouse the neighbors. One of the first to arrive at the murder house was E. C. Jessurun, owner of the bungalow court in which Taylor lived. He said he heard a shot last night, but paid no attention to it, as he thought it was an automobile backfiring. The noise was also heard by Mrs. Douglas MacLean, movie actress, living in one of the court bungalows. "When I entered the room," Jessurun said, "it was in absolutely good condition, indicating no struggle. "Taylor was lying in front of his desk, the blood all over his face. "It would have been impossible for him to have been shot by anyone outside of the bungalow. Whoever did it was inside Taylor's room. "As I remember, a light was burning all night in the Taylor apartment." Charles Eyton, manager of the Famous Players-Lasky company, said that to his knowledge Taylor did not have an enemy in the world. Money to the amount of $78.20 was found in Taylor's pockets. Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean, motion picture stars, who live next door to Taylor, said they heard a shot fired about 8:30. Mrs. MacLean said she opened the door and saw a man leaving Taylor's residence. She got no description of him. Mrs. C. F. Reddick, who lives in a house across the courtyard from the motion picture director, said she heard three shots fired about 2 a.m. One bullet, however, had struck Taylor. It entered his left side immediately below the heart and death was caused by hemorrhage. Other neighbors, when they heard the shot, were not sure it was a revolver shot. They listened but heard no further commotion, so came to the conclusion that it must have been the exhaust of an automobile. Taylor's body was removed to the Harvey-Overholtzer undertaking parlors where a complete examination will be made to determine from just what angle the fatal shot was fired. Not a thing in the well-furnished house was disturbed. Peavey said that everything was just as he had left it when he went home at 7 o'clock last night. Taylor was one of the best known, best liked motion picture directors in the game today. Many prominent stars of the film world gathered at his home. Taylor lived alone at the modest apartment where he had been for the past three years. Here, neighbors say, he practically immersed himself in his art, occasionally entertaining friends. About the walls of his workshop living room hang scores of autographed photos of famous movie folk, his intimates and associates. The apartment is on two floors. Upstairs are the bedrooms where Taylor, on his dressing table, kept a loaded revolver. The weapon was found lying on the dresser this morning. Charles Eyton, manager of the Famous Players-Lasky company, said that no stone would be left unturned to run his murderer to earth. It is believed that the only man who had a grudge against the director was Edward Sands. Taylor is said by the police to have had incriminating evidence against Sands in connection with the robbery of his house several months ago. Sands is said to have formerly been a butler to the motion picture man and is now being hunted for burglary. Detective Sergeant Zeigler, said that among the effects found untouched in the house was jewelry, which he declares was taken by Sands, the former butler, and returned from Stockton, from which point Sands had sent the pawn tickets with a sarcastic note. Miss Normand said that when she left, Taylor told her that he would call her as soon as she reached her home, but when he did not call, she began to wonder what was the matter. The police believe that the murder was perpetrated more for revenge or as it had been pointed out, to prevent Taylor telling what he knew of the burglary.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 2, 1922 LOS ANGELES RECORD Last to See W. D. TaylorMabel Normand, the last person known to have seen William D. Taylor arrive, arrived at Taylor's home last night at approximately 7 o'clock, she said. He had just finished dinner and was talking over the telephone, as Miss Normand came in. Taylor's valet let her in the door and in a few moments Taylor said "good-bye" on the telephone and came out and spoke to Miss Normand. For the next 45 minutes the actress and Taylor sat discussing scenarios and a book which the director had purchased that day from a department store as a gift for Miss Normand. He had phoned her at her home earlier in the afternoon, requesting her to call at his home for the book. Miss Normand was at her bank earlier in the afternoon and had phoned her home, receiving Taylor's message to the effect that he had already sent her one book from a book store, but had got the book that she wanted at a department store, and requested her to stop at his apartment on her way home to pick up the book. The Sennett star left Taylor at 7:45 and arrived home by 8 o'clock, she asserted. When she left Taylor's home, he escorted her to her car and in the presence of her chauffeur, bade her good night. When Miss Normand arrived at Taylor's residence he had just finished dinner and his valet was clearing the table, she said. Completing this work, he said good night and left. He was seen talking to Miss Normand's chauffeur for about five minutes afterward. Miss Normand arrived home at approximately 8 o'clock and retired to her room, where at about 8:15 she had dinner served in bed. The first information the star received of Taylor's death was at 7:30 this morning, when Miss Edna Purviance phoned her and informed her that Taylor's negro valet, who had just opened the door to enter the house, came running into the yard, screaming. The light in the house, Miss Purviance informed Miss Normand, had been burning all night. Taylor had asked Miss Normand if he could not take her to dinner. Miss Normand replied "no," she was tired and was going home to eat dinner and retire early. Taylor promised to call Miss Normand within an hour. He never called her.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 2, 1922 LOS ANGELES RECORD Just a cocktail shaker, and besides it two stemmed glasses with sediment of orange juice and gin in the bottom, and two half-buried cigarettes on the tray. That was the only evidence of sociability that marked the last hour of William D. Taylor's spectacular film career. This morning the remnant of Taylor's hospitality stood out as the only trace of disorder in his magnificent bachelor apartments at 404B South Alvarado street. Except where his huge body fell across the highly polished floor, with a big arm chair toppling over him. The bewitching smiles, frowns and pensive moods of beautiful Mary Miles Minter, film star, gazed from various photographs around the walls of his living room. If those pictures could speak, the assassin who shot Taylor from the back could be vividly described. From a secluded corner, Mary Pickford's autographed likeness beamed its friendship for the popular director. America's most popular star had written her appreciation of Taylor's patience in directing her. Taylor was a man of discriminating taste as to the furnishings of his apartments. A few choice vases, a leather bound set of Encyclopedia Brittanica in a small bookcase, a few choice ivory carved ornaments on his piano, an expensive oriental rug--that was about all that adorned his living room, except-- Taylor, the man, was for business first. There was no mistaking that part of his nature. His tiny mahogany desk, which was placed against the front of the house, was littered with letters, canceled checks and bills. That he lived to himself was noted by the many personal things that surrounded him. He was a man of modest taste. Even though he was rich and his house luxuriously furnished, there was no sign of extravagance, gaudiness or show about his abode. A copy of Floyd Dells' "Moon Calf," with a hand-painted ribbon marking his progress in the popular story, was on a stand by the piano. The dining-room was orderly, save where the police had been forced to move the blood-stained rugs through from the living room. Strange were the stories told about Taylor today--while his lifeless body was being moved to the Ivy Overholtzer undertaking parlor. He was tall, handsome, charming to meet--that is, if one was fortunate enough to meet him. But he was mysterious of habits. He was quiet, unobtrusive and never entertained women in his bachelor apartments alone. Four years he had lived in the severe, cold-looking colonial apartment court. Four years he had been there, but in that time he was unknown to others who lived there. He seldom entertained. And when he did--his visitors left at a reasonable hour. They were always quiet, just like himself. And when he had work to do, Taylor would not answer the doorbell, the telephone, but would stay locked in his apartment, until everything was finished. It was just his manner. Likewise--he did not believe in "wild parties" at his home. In the four years he had lived at the place he had entertained upon three memorable occasions, and there were crowds, chaperons, and the parties broke up early. And they tell how very inconspicuously he dressed. Always he was well groomed--that is what those who were fortunate enough to get a glimpse of the man say--but never what was called "a fashion plate." He hadn't been home of evenings lately much--because the light in his living room had been out. That was the way neighbors knew that the popular director was about. Taylor was silent about his business affairs. He discussed them with nobody. He kept his own counsel, just as he preferred to live alone. His heart affairs were also seldom discussed. But that Miss Minter was very popular with the dead man was discerned by the fact that her telephone number led the list in the directory in his telephone booth. Likewise, other film favorites had their place in his calling list, but his name has not been linked with any of them, although he was known as an eligible bachelor. Were his thoughts on Mabel Normand when Taylor went to his mysterious death? She had been his guest in the evening. At 8:30 o'clock he saw her to her car. He returned, locked the door and stood at his desk ready to resume work. Just above his work, pinned to the lacy draperies on the window, was the somewhat pouty, impudent, but adorable face of Mabel Normand--looking at him. But who killed William D. Taylor?* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 2, 1922 LOS ANGELES RECORD Deputy Public Administrator L. P. Waterman took charge of the murdered Wm. D. Taylor's personal effects late this morning. These included recent letters from Ethel Daisy Taylor, daughter of the deceased, living at Mamaraneck, New York. Judging from their contents, the daughter is in her 'teens and attending a finishing school. According to Waterman, Taylor had been working on his income tax some time during the evening. An itemized account of his income, which gave the total at $38,000 a year was found by Waterman. The high literary tastes of the deceased motion picture director are revealed by the books piled on the table at which Taylor had been at work when he was shot. These included John Maysefield's "Collected Poems," John Galsworthy's "In Chancery," Knut Hamsun's "Dreamers," Gorky's "Stories of the Steppe," John Dos Passos' "Three Soldiers," Conrad Aiken's "Punch" and Eunice Tietjens' "Profiles from China." On the fly leaf of each of these books, their owner had written "Wm. D. Taylor." The theory of Frank O'Connor, formerly an assistant director under Taylor and now director for Marshal Neilan, is that he was shot by a person kneeling. He pointed out that the bullet entered the body rather low on the left side and made its way upward in a slanting direction to a point beneath the right shoulder. O'Conner insisted that this theory was supported by the fact that Taylor's clothing was burned and there were powder marks on his flesh. He had been dead about 10 hours, according to the information received by O'Connor. Taylor had been working on a part for a woman star in a new Lasky production during the afternoon, according to friends. "I left him talking over one of those books with Miss Normand at about 7 o'clock," said Harry Peavey, his colored valet. "'Anything more you want?'" I asked him," Peavey said he inquired of Taylor. "He told me he didn't and I went home."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 2, 1922 R. W. Borough LOS ANGELES RECORD Negro Valet Sobs Tragedy"'Good night, Henry good night,' he said to me when I left him yesterday," said Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored valet between sobs as he told of the tragedy that ended the life of his beloved employer last night. "'Good night, Mr. Taylor,' I said to him, and that's the last I saw of him until I opened the door this morning and found his dead body, his feet stretching toward me on the floor." The negro broke into soft sobs and then declared passionately: "I wish I could get the man that did it. I'd go to jail for the rest of my life if I could get him." As Peavey talked, he was taking some white cloths clotted with blood from a wire paper basket and placing them in the court incinerator. "His blood," the negro said pathetically. "We just used the cloths to clean up the room." "Mr. Taylor was the most wonderful man I ever worked for and I don't see how anybody would want to kill him. I have been with him six months." Peavey said that he came to Taylor's apartment early today, intending to go through the usual round of his duties. "I was going to fix his bath water for him." said the valet, "and then give him his dose of medicine. After that I was going to fix his breakfast-- a couple of boiled eggs, some toast and a glass of orange juice. "When I opened the door I saw him lying there stretched out on the floor, his feet toward me and the floor all bloody. "I turned and screamed and the landlord came rushing in." Peavey said he lived at 127 1/2 Third Street. "I have not been staying with Taylor during the night, but have been sleeping in my room." Peavey's theory was that somebody slipped into the open door of Taylor's apartment when Taylor took Mabel Normand to her car late last night, and shot him from ambush inside the room.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 2, 1922 LOS ANGELES RECORD Mary Minter HeartbrokenTears streaming down here pretty face, Mary Miles Minter, famous motion picture star, hurried to the door of the Taylor bungalow at noon today and asked brokenly: "It isn't true, is it?" "Taylor is dead," said Detective Sergeant H. J. Wallis. "Oh my God, I can't believe it," Miss Minter cried in despair. She turned in her grief to her mother, who had accompanied her to the bungalow court in her automobile. "And I saw him only yesterday," she said. "His car passed mine at Seventh and Alvarado--it was the first time I knew it was gray." Miss Minter was one of the chief mourners at the Undertaking parlors of the Ivy Overholtzer company, where Taylor's body was taken. Miss Minter was leaning upon the arm of her grandmother. The star cried and offered to do anything she could to aid police in solving the mystery. Kathlyn Williams, cinema star, and wife of Charlie Eyton, general manager of Famous-Players Lasky company, was also a visitor at the undertakers to view the body. Robert [sic] O'Conner, director under Taylor, called at the undertaking parlors also. Many telephone calls have been received at the funeral parlors regarding the case. Inquest over the body of the motion picture director will probably be held early Saturday morning. No funeral arrangements have been made. Police have not located the relatives of the deceased man.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 2, 1922 LONG BEACH TELEGRAML.A. Film Producer Assassinated Lasky Director is Found With Bullet in BackShot down while writing at a desk by a mysterious assassin, William Desmond Taylor, well known motion picture producer and director, was found dead today in his bungalow in the Westlake District. Death was caused by a bullet wound in the back, just below the left shoulder, according to police. Taylor, who was 50 years old and wealthy, apparently was killed between 9 and 10 o'clock last night. The body was found today by a colored servant when he reported for duty at the house. Police detectives who first reached the scene reported that death was from natural causes and it was not until nearly an hour later when an undertaker was removing the body that the bullet wound was found. Additional officers immediately were dispatched to the house and a comprehensive investigation was began. The bullet wound caused an internal hemorrhage and Taylor accidentally died a few minutes after being attacked. Detectives questioned neighbors, who stated they heard what apparently was the report of the revolver shortly after 9 p.m. but at that time believed it was caused by an automobile. The police immediately began search for Edward F. Sands, former secretary of Taylor. Robbery was not the motive for the murder it was announced, as officers found $73 in the pocket of the slain man, as well as a large amount of jewelry in the house. Taylor's revolver was found in a drawer of the dresser in his bedroom on the second floor of the pretentious house. It had not been discharged and none of his personal effects had been disturbed. The officers reported they are confident that revenge was the motive of the mysterious slayer. The police records state that when Taylor went to England a year ago on a business and pleasure trip he left Sands, then his secretary, in charge of his personal affairs and when he returned he reported to Detective Sergeants Herman Cline and E. R. Cato that Sands had robbed him of money, jewelry, clothing and a valuable automobile. A felony warrant was issued for Sands and the police say he never was found. A second robbery at the Taylor residence was attributed to Sands by the police. Among the witnesses questioned by the police during the morning were Mabel Normand, Edna Purviance and Douglas MacLean, prominent film stars. Miss Normand admitted having visited Taylor's bungalow in the early evening yesterday to discuss a new production and that he had escorted her to her automobile at the curb shortly before 9 p.m. Taylor was to telephone to her later in the evening. Miss Normand said he did not do so. Miss Purviance, who lives in a house adjoining Taylor's bungalow, returned home about midnight and saw a light burning in Taylor's study. MacLean and his wife, who live in the same district, stated they heard the shot fired after 9 o'clock. They thought at the time it might be an automobile exhaust. They described a strange man whom they saw in the street. Miss Normand told detectives that while she was talking with Taylor early last evening concerning a new picture production the robberies of the Taylor home were mentioned. "He told me he feared Sands and that he had a premonition of something wrong," Miss Normand was quoted as telling officers. Charles Maigne, an actor, said he was riding with Taylor last Monday and that he warned Taylor to guard against his former employee. In the first robbery, while Taylor was in Europe, the house was completely ransacked. All the director's clothing was taken and his automobile was found later in a damaged condition. The money entrusted to Sands, the valet secretary, by the motion picture director for the payment of current bills had been spent for other purposes, the bills being paid with forged checks, it was charged. Accounts had been opened in Taylor's name at several Los Angeles department stores and large quantities of goods ordered. Lingerie and women's garments were predominant which created the supposition that the valet was led to his embezzlements by a sweetheart. Many checks had been forged, the large check book filled with forged signatures, some of them spoiled, was found by Taylor. He placed this matter in the hands of the police. A few weeks ago the Alvarado street house was again broken into under mysterious circumstances. The back door was literally wrecked in gaining entrance. Nothing was taken by the burglars except jewelry and a stock of gold tipped cigarettes of an exclusive brand. The marauders leisurely devoured food they found in the ice box, but did not touch a bottle of champagne there in their ransacking. They walked about with dusty shoes on the bed upstairs. This was reported to the police. A week later Mr. Taylor's colored servant found the butt of a gold tipped cigarette on the front doorstep one morning. "Pardon me, Mr. Taylor, but have you bought more of these cigarettes," he asked? "No," said the director, and examined the butt. It was the butt of one of the stolen stock. One of the burglars had returned for some inexplicable reason and enjoyed a midnight smoke on the doorstep of his victim. It was following the second robbery that a mystery letter marked from Sacramento was received Taylor. This letter was signed "Alias Jimmy V." It read as follows: "Dear Mr. Taylor, So sorry to inconvenience you, even temporarily. Also observe the lesson of forced sale of assets. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. (Signed) "Alias Jimmy V." Two pawn tickets were enclosed in the letter. Taylor told his friend that he recognized the handwriting on the letter. Police detectives today sought to recover the pawn tickets from among Taylor's belongings and began a search for the man whom the film director had told his friend was the writer of the mysterious "Jimmy V.' letters.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 2, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXPRESS With a gaping bullet wound in his left breast the body of William Desmond Taylor, one of the best known motion picture directors in the world, was found beside his desk in his home at 404 South Alvarado street, where he had fallen, the victim of an unknown assassin. The gruesome discovery was made by Henry Peavey of 127 1/2 East Third street, a negro, who was employed as a butler by Mr. Taylor, shortly after 8 o'clock this morning. Motion picture circles in Los Angeles and throughout the world were shocked by news of the slaying and hundreds of messages began pouring into Los Angeles asking for confirmation of the fact and for details of the slaying. Within a short time after the new murder mystery that is baffling the Los Angeles police department had been brought to light detectives began quizzing Miss Mabel Normand, Miss Edna Purviance and Douglas MacLean, all prominent in the motion picture world. After talking with these persons, Detective Sergeants Winn, Zeigler, Murphy and Wallis announced that a nation-wide search had been ordered for Edward F. Sands, who was formerly employed as a secretary by Taylor. It is believed Sands, who had an intimate knowledge of Taylor's movements and his associates, may assist the police in solving the murder. Six months ago Taylor returned to Los Angeles after a tour of Europe. Then he learned that a man he had employed had "raised" a number of personal checks and had stolen many suits of his clothes. He reported the robbery to the police and charged that the man had secured many thousands of dollars by his illegal methods. A police search was being made for this man when Mr. Taylor's house was again entered and a number of suits and articles of jewelry were taken. It was after this second robbery that Mr. Taylor received a letter. It read: "Dear Mr. Taylor--So sorry to inconvenience you, even temporarily; also observe the lesson of the forced sale of assets. (signed) "Alias Jimmy V." From Miss Normand and other persons the police learned that Mr. Taylor had often expressed fear that some time this man would return and do him bodily harm. The police are not, however, basing their investigation now upon the theory that the thief was the slayer. Instead, they at present list it as a "murder mystery." The slayer evidently committed the crime about near 9 o'clock last night. It was at that time that Douglas MacLean, motion picture actor, and his wife, who lived next door, say they heard the sound of the pistol shot. Police also believe that the slaying occurred at that time because of the opinion expressed by the deputy coroner that the man had been dead for more than ten hours when the body was found The last person who saw Taylor alive, with the exception of the assassin, was Miss Mabel Normand, film star. She visited him at his home last night. She arrived at the home shortly before 7 o'clock, she said. Her statement to Detectives Winn and Murphy follows: "I had my chauffeur drive out to Mr. Taylor's home last evening, as we had a number of business matters to discuss. I should judge that I arrived there a little before 7 o'clock. It was while I was there that we again discussed the case of a man who had been in Mr. Taylor's employ and who stole from him. "I asked Mr. Taylor what he intended doing with the man if he was captured--and he said he would see that the man was prosecuted. We then discussed a certain scenario that I had written and a scenario that a friend of mine had written. "While we were talking, William [sic] Peavey, Mr. Taylor's butler, was moving about in the two rooms. It was then, also that Mr. Taylor told me that William was in some little trouble. He said that his servant had been arrested on a charge of vagrancy and that he had been forced to go down to the police station and deposit $200 bail for him. "He said that he intended appearing in police court at a o'clock [sic] this afternoon and said he would do what he could to aid his servant if he was convinced that the man was not guilty. But he said that if Peavey had been guilty of doing any wrong that he would be forced to discharge him. "After we had discussed a few other trifling matters Mr. Taylor asked me if I would remain and have dinner with him. I excused myself and told him that I must hurry to my home. He then asked me if he might visit me later that night and I told him I should be glad if he would come over to my home. He promised to call me on the telephone some time about 9 o'clock. "Mr. Taylor then accompanied me from his house to my automobile. My chauffeur, William Davis, was seated in the machine and heard Mr. Taylor bid me good-night. He spoke to all of us and bid us good-night. We talked for a few minutes longer and Mr. Taylor turned and walked up toward his house and my machine moved away. I have not seen him since." Davis, who lives at 1920 Las Palmas avenue, when questioned by the officers said the same story as did Miss Normand, and said that when they left there was no one moving about the yard that surrounds the house in which the tragedy occurred. It is evident, the detectives believe that Taylor after he entered the house sat down at once in front of his desk and that the assassin entered a few minutes later. The papers on the desk were mussed up and there were a large number of canceled checks lying upon the desk. Miss Normand, in her statement to the police stated that the desk was in the same condition when she left the house, about 8 or 8:30 o'clock last night. It was at midnight that Miss Edna Purviance, who resides in the house adjoining Mr. Taylor's to the west, returned home. At that time, she said she noticed that the lights were burning in Mr. Taylor's house. She went to the door, she said, and rang the bell and knocked upon the door. When she failed to secure a response she returned to her own home, believing Mr. Taylor probably had left the house after forgetting to turn off the electric light switch. At the time she was knocking upon the door the body of her friend was just behind the door within a few feet of her. As detectives reconstruct the murder scene, they believe that the slayer opened the door a few minutes after Miss Normand had left, at the time Taylor was seated on a chair in front of the desk checking over the canceled checks. As Taylor half rose from his chair the slayer stepped into the room, and with pistol carefully aimed, pulled the trigger. The bullet entered the left breast just below the shoulder and ranged downward through the heart. Taylor fell over backward mortally wounded and probably died within a few seconds after he had been shot. But one shot was fired. The person who wielded the gun was evidently experienced in the handling of firearms and an excellent marksman. From the appearance of the wound it was evidently a .32 caliber pistol. The police believe that this was the caliber of the pistol because it made so little noise that the slayer was able to leave the house without attracting significant attention. When Peavey arrived and opened the house this morning all of the electric lights were burning just as they had been when Miss Purviance knocked at the door. Robbery was clearly not the motive of the crime. A purse containing $78 and a very valuable watch were found in the clothing on the body. There was no indication that any search had been made of the house for valuables and nothing was found to be missing when a careful check of the effects were made by Charles Eyton, manager of the Lasky studios and a close friend of the dead man. Charles Maigne, a friend of the dead man. told officers that he was positive that Taylor believed that sometime an enemy might return and do him harm. Douglas MacLean and his wife were having their supper in their home that also adjoins Taylor's house, but to the east, when they heard the sound of a shot. They place the time at about 9:30 or 9 o'clock in the statement they made to Detective Sergeants Wallis and Ziegler. Mrs. MacLean, however, told the officers that she noticed a man walking rapidly down the walk towards Taylor's home last evening shortly after Miss Normand left. She gave the following description of the man to officers: Height about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches, weight about 165 pounds. He had a muffler about his neck and was at the time wearing a plaid cap pulled over his eyes. She did not notice the clothing he was wearing and was unable to furnish the police with a better description because she says, she was unable to see distinctly at that hour of the night. "I had of course, no reason to be suspicious of that man at that time," said Mrs. MacLean, when discussing the case with the two detective sergeants. "But now I am convinced that he was the slayer. It was after I had seen him that my husband and I sat down to dinner. That was about 8:30 or 9 o'clock, I guess. "We had just started our dinner when we heard a pistol shot. We did not investigate because we heard nothing further after that to arouse our suspicions and we thought that possibly the sound we heard then was that of an automobile backfiring in the street. Now, of course, we know that it was the shot that ended the life of Mr. Taylor." Mr. MacLean corroborated the statement made by his wife and the servant employed by the couple also told the officers that she plainly heard the shot while she was seated in the kitchen of the house. Mrs. C. F. Reddick of 410 A. South Alvarado street, who lives near by, told the police that she was awakened shortly after 1 o'clock last night by the sound of three shots. She said that she believed they came from the direction of the Taylor home. A systematic search of the neighborhood is being made by police in an effort to learn if any person or persons saw who last entered or left the Taylor home. They are also anxious to learn if any other persons in the neighborhood saw the man described by Mrs. MacLean loitering about and are anxious to secure a better description of the man. Detective Captain Dave Adams announced that he will run the assassin to earth if it becomes necessary to detail 20 detectives and a number of private investigators to the case. Upon the orders of Chief Deputy Coroner William McDonald the body was removed to the mortuary of the Ivy H. Overholtzer Undertaking Company, where an inquest will be held. The date of the inquest has not as yet been set, but it will probably be either Saturday or Monday, next, it is believed. Motion picture circles in Los Angeles were shocked when the first news of the murder reached them in an extra edition of the Evening Express. The blow was particularly felt at the Lasky studio; where Taylor was known to every actor, actress, property man and other employees. Immediately on receipt of the news work at the studios and on location ceased and men and women, their pallor showing through the grease paint of their makeups, gathered in knots to discuss the tragedy and speculate on what prompted the crime. Many theories were offered, among them revenge for fancied wrong, desire for gain and jealousy.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 BOSTON HERALD Los Angeles, Feb. 2--Los Angeles was shocked by fiendish murder today when the body of William Desmond Taylor, aged 50, chief director for the Lasky studios, was found in his home at 404 South Alvarado Street, shortly after 9 o'clock today. Taylor had been shot through the heart. The gruesome discover was made by Henry Peazey [sic] of 127 East Third Street, a negro servant, when he arrived at the home where Taylor lived alone. The body was lying beside a desk where Taylor had been going over a number of canceled checks he had received yesterday from the bank. Following a preliminary inquiry the police questioned Mabel Normand, the film star, when they received reports that she and others were at Taylor's home about 8:30 o'clock last night. Conflicting stories were told to the police as to the time of the shooting. According to Douglas MacLean, who lives near by, he heard the shot at 9 o'clock. Another report was that the shooting occurred about 2 A. M. Miss Normand stated she had visited Taylor's bungalow early in the evening to discuss a new production, and that he escorted her to her automobile at the curb shortly before 9 P. M. Taylor was to telephone to her later in the evening, Miss Normand said, but did not do so. Miss Purviance lives in a house adjoining the Taylor bungalow. She returned home about midnight and saw the light burning in Taylor's apartment, but thought nothing of it. Miss Purviance and Miss Normand were talking over the telephone this morning when Taylor's colored servant found the body and shouted "Murder, murder." MacLean and his wife, who live near the Taylor home, stated that they heard a shot fired shortly after 9 o'clock. They described a strange man whom they saw in the street, the neighbors who heard the report believed it the backfire of an automobile and they observed nothing in Bungalow Court in which the Taylor residence is situated that would lead them to believe there had been an unusual occurrence. The slayer evidently entered the house and shot Taylor as he was working on his checkbook. The moving picture director dropped to the floor and death was caused by an internal hemorrhage. Taylor's revolver was found in a drawer of the dresser in his bedroom on the second floor of his pretentious home. It had not been discharged and none of his personal effects had been disturbed. His jewelry, which was valued at several thousand dollars, was found in one of the dresser drawers by detectives. The officers reported that they are confident revenge was the motive of the mysterious slayer. The police records state that when Taylor went to England a year ago on a business and pleasure trip he left his secretary, Edward F. Sands, in charge of his personal affairs and when he returned he reported to Detective Sergts. Herman Cline and E. R. Cato that Sands had robbed him of money, jewelry, clothing and a valuable automobile. A felony warrant was issued for Sands and the police say he never was found. A second robbery at the Taylor residence was attributed to Sands by the police. Taylor was said by Charles Eyton, manager of Famous Players-Lasky studio, not to have had an enemy in the world. When the body was first found neighbors called central police station and policemen who visited the scene turned in a report that Taylor had died as the result of a hemorrhage. It was not until Deputy Coroner William McDonald reached the Alvarado street address and made a close inspection of the body that the bullet wound was discovered. The bullet had struck just below the neck on the left side and ranged downward through the heart. From the position of the wound detectives believe that the slayer at the time he fired the shot stood above Taylor. Robbery evidently was not the motive for the crime. A purse containing $78 was found lying in the desk beside the body. The slayer had made no effort to take any articles from the house. ...Authorities resumed their questioning of Mabel Normand this afternoon for facts connected with the murder. Mrs. Julia Crawford Ivers, continuity editor for the Lasky organization, long known as a close friend of the murdered man, is also expected to throw some light on the affair. Other female acquaintances of the director will also be questioned. The theory now being worked on is that a jealous woman either shot Taylor or had him shot. That a woman actually did the slaying is the more generally accepted theory...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 3, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINERJealous Man Hunted As Slayer of Taylor! Revenge for Attention Paid to Girl Regarded As Motive For CrimeOfficers last night were concentrating their efforts on locating a mysterious desperado who is sought as the slayer of William Desmond Taylor, one of the best known directors in the motion picture world, who was found murdered at his bungalow home of 404-B South Alvarado street yesterday morning. The officers were diligently following the trail of the mysterious man after they learned that several times the strange nocturnal visitor had been driven away by Taylor at the point of a gun. But two weeks ago, the investigators said Taylor found this man trying to gain entrance to the bungalow by means of a bedroom window. The window was half open and Taylor is said to have driven him away. Many times the murdered director is said to have heard unusual noises about the house and upon investigation found the unwelcome visitor prowling about the building or premises, but each time Taylor flourished a gun and drove him away. And then again, the police say in trying to weave a chain of incriminating evidence about the hunted man, Taylor received telephone calls which brought forth no response when he answered. It is believed the calls came from this person who was ascertaining if any one was at home at the bungalow. It was within half an hour after Mabel Normand, famous screen actress, and Taylor had a chat early Wednesday evening that he was killed, the police believe. They are also trying to run down clews which they say have found and which indicate that jealousy or revenge was the motive. They are inclined to believe that the former is the possible solution of the death. That a man committed the crime is based upon information furnished by Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of the film star, who lives next door to the Taylor home, and by her maid. They say they saw a mysterious man at the Taylor home before and after the murder. A .38 caliber steel-nose bullet caused Taylor's death. This was determined and the bullet found when Autopsy Surgeon Wagner performed a post mortem on the body early last night. The bullet had penetrated the back beneath the left shoulder blade, pierced the heart and then took a right upward course into the neck, where it lodged. While three theories are being considered by the police, certain material clews developed late yesterday lead them to believe that behind the tragedy is the shadow of a woman. The partly told story of Taylor's murder is this: At 6:45 Wednesday night he ate dinner in his little bungalow court home. He was alone. His servant was the only other person in the house. Shortly after 7 o'clock, Miss Mabel Normand. famous screen star, and whose engagement to the slain man had been generally rumored for many months but, denied by her, went to the Taylor home. She remained according to her story to the police, until about 7:45 o'clock. She had called for the purpose of obtaining a book that Taylor desired her to read. When she left, Taylor escorted her to her automobile, waiting at the entrance to the bungalow court. When Taylor departed from the house with Miss Normand he left the door open. What happened? The servant, Henry Peavey, a negro who has been with Taylor for about six months, said Miss Normand and Taylor were together in the living room when he left to go to his own home about 7:20 o'clock. Yesterday morning, as was his custom, he arrived to prepare breakfast at 7:30 o'clock. He had a key to the front door and opened it. He started to go in and then noticed Taylor lying on his back with his feet near the door. The servant did not enter. When Taylor faded to answer his alarmed cries he rushed to the home of a neighbor and called the police. Some time between 7:45 o'clock and 7:55 o'clock the night before, Taylor had been shot. Here are the theories on which police detectives are concentrating their efforts. Taylor was shot by--1. A woman he had scorned or whom he had enraged.2. A discarded suitor of some woman with whom he had been friendly.3. A burglar who was surprised by Taylor when he returned to the house after escorting Miss Normand to her car. Among the clews being followed by the police is one furnished by employees at the Morosco Theater, who stated that several weeks ago a man inquired for Taylor's address and by his insistence and strange actions aroused their suspicions. The officers are trying to locate this individual, who would not take 'no" for an answer to his questions as to where the director resided. A former secretary whom Taylor had caused to be arrested for forgery and who is said to have threatened his life, is being sought for information he may be able to give bearing on the case. Taylor is known to have been friendly with many women. He is said to have been a man of charming personality and of considerable magnetism. Outside of one particular prominent woman he was not known, say police, to have been particularly interested in any one. It is possible, say police, that some man, enamored of any one of the women with whom Taylor might have been on friendly terms, could have become enraged, waited his opportunity at the Taylor home, and then killed Taylor from ambush. Every possible angle of Taylor's private life is now being investigated by the detectives in connection with the first two theories. That the second will prove to be correct the officers believe. This belief is based on what Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of a motion picture director, residing in the house next to that of Taylor, saw. At 7:10, according to Mrs. MacLean's maid, Mr. and Mrs. MacLean sat down to dinner. While the second course was being served the maid claims to have heard footsteps of a man in a rear alley running between the two houses. She commented upon it to her employers, but thought nothing of it until she heard of the murder yesterday morning. At 7:50 o'clock, six minutes after Miss Normand left with Taylor to go to her machine, Mrs. MacLean heard a shot and went to her door. A man was just leaving the Taylor home. He was not Sands, the valet. Mrs. MacLean is sure of this, she says. She knew Sands. When she saw the man he was just stepping through the door. He turned half-way around, glanced back through the door and then pulled it shut. He saw her, she says, as she stood watching him, but did not show any alarm. She closed her door just as he started away from the Taylor home. He walked, she declared, not out to Alvarado street to the main entrance, but disappeared through the alley leading between Taylor's house and hers. The mysterious visitor was large of stature. wore dark rough clothing and had a muffler and cap on. She could not see his face. This man, the police believe, is the murderer. They believe it was he whom the MacLean's maid heard as she was serving dinner. It is probable, they think, that he was acquainted with Taylor's habits. Friends say that Taylor left the door open when he left his home for a few minutes. The mysterious visitor is believed to have secreted himself around the corner of the house and watched until Taylor came out with Miss Normand. As the two walked toward the film star's car, the assassin probably hurried into the house through the door left open by his victim. When Taylor was found his body was lying with the head toward the east wall, directly in front of a writing desk. The feet were near the door, the legs outstretched. He was on his back. It is the police theory that when he returned to the house after bidding Miss Normand good night he sat down at the desk to work. An open check book was lying on the desk, a pen nearby, when the murder was discovered. The murderer, waiting behind a pillar in the room, stepped out when he believed Taylor to be settled in the chair and fired. The bullet entered below the left shoulder blade and penetrated the heart. Taylor died instantly, pitched forward and in failing upset the chair. The chair was found lying across his legs when the body was discovered. Intimate friends say that it was the one used by Taylor at his desk. The murderer is then believed to have hurried to the door, glanced back just as Mrs. MacLean discovered him and then fled through the alley. When Peavey, the servant, saw the body of his dead master, as he opened the front door yesterday morning, screaming into the bungalow court yard, Mrs. Verne Dumas, who heard his cries, called the police. Detectives who responded made a casual examination, but did not turn the body over until Coroner Nance reached the scene. The first report issued from the headquarters was that Taylor had died of natural of causes. As soon as it became known that the director had been murdered Detective Captain David Adams assigned every available officer to the case. Officials from the public administrator's office were sent to the house and took charge of the dead man's personal effects. Thousands of dollars worth of jewels were found in his bedroom. A half completed income tax blank lying on the desk showed his annual income to be $37,000. Coroner Nance ordered the body sent to the undertaking parlors of Ivy Overholtzer on South Flower street and detectives then began the work of running down the murderer. According to Peavey, the servant, his murdered master had no enemies that he knew of nor had he had any difficulty with any guest that had visited the house while he was present. When he left for the night Wednesday, Taylor seemed to be in high spirits and was conversing in an animated manner with Miss Normand. Police are convinced that the servant can throw no light on the mystery. Miss Normand told Detective Sergeants Wallace and Ziegler that she had gone to two jewelry stores downtown before she went to Taylor's home. They were closed and after buying some peanuts from a vendor at Seventh street and Broadway and a copy of the Police Gazette she hurried to Taylor's home. Her story and that of her chauffeur, William Davis, coincide. Miss Normand claims that she left the Taylor home about 7:45 o'clock, and that the director walked with her to the machine, leaving, as was his custom, the door open behind him. When they reached the car, she says, her chauffeur had been reading the magazine. He hastily threw it aside and Taylor saw it. The couple had been discussing literature and he chided her good naturedly about reading that type of magazine. She says that after she left Taylor at the curbing she immediately returned to her home. While in Taylor's home she had discussed with Taylor a certain charge made against his negro servant involving social vagrancy. Miss Normand was informed by motion picture friends of the tragedy soon after the body was discovered. She refused to receive callers outside of headquarters officers and close intimate friends. To further the theory that Taylor was killed by some one other than his former valet, police point to a story told by a guest in the Dumas home, near by, who claims that on last Monday night early he saw two men go up to the door of the Taylor home, try the door with a key and then walk away. One of these men is believed to have been the murderer. Several others in the block beside Mr. and Mrs. MacLean claim to have heard the fatal shot. E. C. Jessurum, owner of the court, who was ill in bed heard it and called it to the attention of his wife. who was reading to him. Not hearing a second shot, they thought nothing of the interruption. One of the first visitors at the Taylor home after police detectives had taken charge was Mary Miles Minter, mutual friend of Miss Normand and the murdered man. Friends had informed her of the tragedy. Accompanied by her mother, she hurried to the Taylor home, but was met at the door by Detective Sergeant Hermann Cline, who briefly told her what had happened. She became hysterical and it was several minutes before she could talk coherently. She said that Taylor had directed her in three pictures and that she considered him an intimate friend. She knew of no enemies that might have sought his death, she said. "Why, he was a wonderful man," she added, "and every one that knew him loved him." This sentiment was voiced too, by her mother. Miss Minter said that the last time she saw Taylor was Wednesday afternoon, when she met him at the corner of Seventh and Alvarado streets. That Taylor had a premonition of his death and told several friends was learned last night. According to Mrs. J. M. Berger, income tax specialist, who is at present engaged by Miss Normand, the murdered man told her Wednesday afternoon that "he felt that something was going to happen to him." They laughed the subject away, though, and apparently Taylor forgot it. He told the same thing to other persons--friends in the motion picture colony, but all ridiculed the idea. The house in which Taylor was found is lavishly furnished. The lower floor consists of a living room, dining room and kitchen. Upstairs, with the stairway leading from the dining room, are two bedrooms. One of these rooms was used by Taylor to sleep in. The other was reserved as a guest chamber. Photographs, all of them affectionately autographed, of famous stars, whom Taylor had directed are the most conspicuous decorations in the living room. These include one of Mary Pickford, who describes Taylor as "the most patient man I ever knew." A search of the house by detectives and the deputy police administrator revealed a large quantity of expensive bonded liquors. This was taken charge of together with his other personal effects. Late yesterday afternoon Detective Captain Adams assigned Detectives Sergeants Hermann Cline, Murphy and Winn to the case. The detectives, after interviewing Miss Normand's chauffeur, admitted that the case is one of the most baffling that has confronted the Los Angeles department for many years. Sands, the former valet being sought, is said to be in Los Angeles, and several friends of Taylor told police last night that they had seen him. Every officer has been furnished with his description and given orders to arrest him on sight. Police are not yet ready, they say, to implicate him in the murder, but he is the one known man who would have a motive for desiring Taylor's death, and his explanation of where he was on the night of the murder is anxiously awaited by officers. If he is innocent, they believe, despite felony warrant already issued for him, he will surrender rather than take the chance of being accused of suspicion of murder by remaining in hiding.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Taylor's Light Burned LateMiss Edna Purviance, who lived in the two-story bungalow adjoining the home of William D. Taylor, the Lasky film director who was shot Wednesday night, said that when she returned to her home some time near midnight Wednesday she noticed lights burning in Mr. Taylor's house, but that as Mr. Taylor was given to burning the midnight oil, being a great reader, she thought nothing of it. "I was awakened," said Miss Purviance last night, "early Thursday morning by the terrifying voice of some one who seemed to be running up and down the court, screaming, 'Mr. Taylor is dead! Mr. Taylor is dead!' I looked out the window and saw his negro boy Henry, who was almost frantic with grief, as he was very much attached to Mr. Taylor. "Before they found the bullet wound in Mr. Taylor's back they thought he had died of heart disease, and that seemed terrible enough, but when we learned he had been murdered, almost at our own door, it seemed too horrible to believe. "I knew Mr. Taylor only very slightly. I had never worked with him and had only met him to a purely formal social way. I thought him to be a very interesting, likable, discerning gentleman, with gallant, polished manners and a brilliant intellect. "I always heard him spoken of as a man with a reputation above reproach and a nature that was kind and generous. Although living as a near neighbor, I saw him very infrequently and knew nothing of his private life or of his love affairs, if he had any. I knew that he and Miss Normand were good friends but knew nothing of heart interest on either side."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 3, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Valet Tells of Finding BodyThere were tears on the cheek of Henry Peavey, colored, who for six months had been employed as William Desmond Taylor's valet, as he told the story yesterday of how he discovered the murdered man's body upon entering the apartment yesterday morning. The night before, when Peavey left to go to his own home, Taylor called a cheery, "Good night, Henry." "I can hear his voice yet," said this humble mourner. "It was the kind of strong, friendly voice that made a man feel good." And then he burst out, "I'd be willing to go to jail for the rest of my life if I could get the man that did it." The valet was at his last task for the master; he was wiping up the blood from the floor, but his sobs shook him at times so that he could not proceed. "I've worked for a lot of men," he went on, "but Mr. Taylor was the most wonderful of all of them. I came here this morning intending to fix his bath and get his breakfast, which I always does. And before the bath I'd bring him a dose of medicine. It was always just the same--for breakfast two soft- boiled-eggs, toast, and a glass of orange juice. "And having it in my mind to make everything just as nice as I could, knowing he would be pleased and say a kind word, I opened the door. "And then I found him stretched out on the floor, which was all bloody and his feet toward the door. "And then I backed to the door, pretty near overcome with horror, and yelled for the landlord. The way I figure it is that somebody slipped in last night when Mr. Taylor took Miss Normand to the car and shot him from hiding. But how could any one kill such a man as he was?" Peavey lives at 127 1/2 East Third street. His habit was to reach the Taylor apartment before breakfast and leave after dinner.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER All the picture studios in Los Angeles were in mourning yesterday. The mysterious murder of William Desmond Taylor shocked the entire motion picture colony and held the focus of attention on every "lot" in Los Angeles. It is probable that no man in the motion picture business had more friends than the slain director. He had directed virtually every well-known star and thus had come in contact with hundreds of men and women in the various studios in which he had worked. The majority of those who learned the circumstances of Taylor's mysterious death were inclined toward the theory that robbery was the motive. They believe a sneak thief had entered the house during Taylor's temporary absence and that Taylor discovered his presence on his return. The subsequent struggle and shot, they believe, frightened the marauder away without any booty. Comments were heard in many studios on the fact that Taylor had had trouble with Ed. F. Sands, former valet-secretary to the dead man. A felony warrant has been out for Sands for several months and many friends of Mr. Taylor expressed a strong wish to learn Sands' present whereabouts. The theory that there was a "love motive' in the crime and that its unraveling will reveal a woman either as the instigator, perpetrator or unconscious motive for the shooting was scoffed at by Taylor's friends. From every "lot" in Los Angeles came the testimony that Taylor had led a life unusually free from feminine entanglements. Charles Eyton, studio manager at Lasky's was emphatic in discrediting the "Cherchez la Femme" theory of the crime... The same opinion ruled among the press representatives at the Laksy studio where Taylor was well known and warmly admired. Arch Reeve, Barrett Kiesling and Al Wilkie, all of whom had known Taylor for years were convinced that robbery was the motive for the killing. They described him as a man of solitary habits, quiet and reserved, whose name the breath of scandal never had touched... Mary Miles Minter was another star who was greatly shocked by the occurrence. With tears streaming down her face she recalled incidents that happened the last time she had talked with the director...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 Lannie Haynes Martin LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Miss Mabel Normand, Mack Sennett film star, who was probably the last friend to see William D. Taylor, the Lasky film director who was shot Wednesday night, alive, told in detail late yesterday afternoon, the time and the incidents of her visit to his home early in the evening, previous to the shooting, and stated that she had no doubt that the person who shot him was the man who had twice robbed him and who had annoyed him with mysterious telephone calls recently. "There was no affair of the heart whatever between William D. Taylor and myself," said Miss Normand yesterday afternoon at her beautiful home in West Seventh and Vermont avenue. "His friendship for me was that of an older man for a girl who liked the outdoor sports he liked and who was eager to glean a little enlightenment from the vast storehouse of knowledge which he possessed. "Mr. Taylor was a man who knew everything. If I wanted to know the meaning of an unusual word I did not have to take the trouble to hunt up a dictionary. I just had my secretary telephone Mr. Taylor. If I wanted to find the name of a painter or sculptor of some rare work of art he was sure to know that, too, and if I were puzzling over some classical or scientific reference in my reading, I only had to ask him to have the entire matter explained, for besides having the education and the instincts of an artist, he was a deep student of science as well. "I liked to go out with Mr. Taylor because there was a certain protective dignity in his quiet high bred manner that prevented the obtrusive, offensively familiar person who had only seen my face on the screen, from running up and saying, 'Hello, Mabel!' and we were the best of pals. I think Mr. Taylor had the finest, highest sense of honor of almost any one I have ever known, and I respected him and admired him more than I can tell. My chief liking for him, however, was because of his wonderful brain and the things he could teach me. I am studying French, and as he spoke French fluently he was of great assistance to me and there was hardly a day that he did not recommend some book to me to read. It was to get a book he had phoned about that I went to his house Wednesday evening about 7 o'clock. "I had been downtown shopping and was at my bank and phoned home to my housekeeper to know if there had been any calls for me. She said Mr. Taylor had phoned that he had the book I wanted, so I attended to a few errands and had my chauffeur drive me by Mr. Taylor's home. I sat down for a few minutes, commented on the change he had made in some bookcases, I had not seen the place in a couple of months. We talked a little of books and plays and he asked me to stay for dinner, saying that although he had had his dinner, he wanted me to try a certain kind of rice pudding his cook had made, but I told him that I had phoned home I would be back to dinner and they were expecting me. "He then told his colored boy that I would not be staying for dinner and the boy went out just ahead of us. Mr. Taylor took me to my car and on the floor of the car were a number of magazines, some of them, were rather light and I suppose sensational. Mr. Taylor expressed surprise that I read such things and rather upbraided me for having such low-brow taste. He gave me the book, as I got in the car. It was one of Freud's latest, and said I will phone after while and see how you like it. That was the last I ever heard his voice. This morning when Edna Purviance rushed in and said Mr. Taylor was dead I was sure it was all some horrible mistake. "I came home from Mr. Taylor's house, had my dinner and was in bed before 9 o'clock. I read a little while and when he did not phone I wondered a little and then thought no more about it and went to sleep. "Mr. Taylor was so uniformly kind to every one. It seems horrible that he should have met a death of this kind, and with the exception of the man who had been in his employ and who had robbed him, I cannot believe he had an enemy in the world. He had a warrant sworn out for the man, but he had never been apprehended. Yesterday Mr. Taylor told his secretary that he had a strange presentment about this man and wished he had not had the warrant sworn-out. "I wish there were something I could do to throw some light on this terrible tragedy, but it was mere chance that took me to his door a few hours before it happened and I feel very indignant as do also the members of my household and the managers and directors of my company, that my name should have been unnecessarily connected with the unhappy event. Any one, out of scores of his acquaintances might have called at his house on that particular evening and it seemed a cruel thing to me that I should be questioned about it. "I have known Mr. Taylor for six or seven years. He had high ideals regarding his work and a far reaching vision that made him have great faith in the wonderful things that the moving picture has yet to do. He not only had an eye for beautiful objects and harmony of composition and arrangement, but he had a soul that appreciated the abstract beauty that these things stood for as symbols. To him loyalty, honor, faith, justice and beauty were realities. They were forces that move the world onward and sculpture out recognized qualities in the human countenance. And it was the clean, wholesome beautiful things of life that he wanted to portray on screen. "Mr. Taylor was a wonderful conversationalist because he observed everything and everybody with the eye of understanding sympathy. He could tell of his travels in Alaska or his trips through Europe and the stories would not be merely geographical descriptions of countries and customs, but philosophical observations that made all of his experiences a commentary on life. "I feel proud to have called such a man friend and am sorry that his extreme modesty and diffidence kept many from knowing the depth and brilliance of his true nature. But he was not in the least pedantic or high- browish. He was full of wit and jest and he would tease and twit me about things I did or wore, and sometimes we would have a perfect gab fest, in slang, just like a couple of kids. He was just an all around, sure-enough human being. "I am just in the middle of a big picture and, of course, I am going right on working, but the sudden news of the tragic death of such a friend as this was naturally a great shock to me and I am all broken up today." Besieged by friends, members of her profession and representatives of the press, Miss Normand denied herself to all callers yesterday and remained in the seclusion of her room, a dainty rose and old ivory boudoir whose walls are lined with books of verse, of plays, of fiction, philosophy, science and history. There were books on the dresser, scattered all over gold-mounted toilet articles, big fat books on art sprawling all over a chaise-lounge, and on a little stand by her bed there were some volumes of poetry and psycho- analytical philosophy. "Yes, I do read a great deal," confessed Miss Normand, "one has to in order to understand what other people are talking about and most of the books you see here were either given me or suggested by Mr. Taylor. I sometimes wondered how he ever got the time to read all the different kinds, of things he had read. "Mr. Taylor was a man who would have been a credit to any profession on the face of the earth, because he lived a clean, wholesome, upright, life of kindness and usefulness to his fellow beings. Those of us who believe in our art and our profession and have ideals and ambitions for the attainment of success and for that thing which is valued above great riches, a good name, feel that we have not only lost a personal friend but that the profession has lost a rare exemplar whose influence will be missed by all."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Tracing the movements of a man suspected of being the slayer of William Desmond Taylor, internationally known film director, who was shot to death in his Alvarado-street apartments Wednesday night, investigators for The Times last night located four witnesses who saw the man before and after the tragedy. Actuated by motives of revenge due to jealousy, the police believe, the murderer fired the fatal shot as near as can be calculated a few minutes before 7:45 p.m., as Mr. Taylor was seated at his writing desk or just as he returned and closed the door when he returned from escorting Mabel Normand, actress, to her car. Between 7:45 and 7:50 p.m., just after the report of the revolver was heard, Mrs. MacLean, wife of Douglas MacLean, the actor, who lives near the Taylor home, saw a man leaving the Taylor apartments. He was described as being about five feet nine or ten inches tall, of medium build and roughly, but not shabbily dressed in dark clothes and a plaid cap. Shortly before 6 o'clock a man answering this description stopped at the Hartley service station, Sixth and Alvarado streets, and inquired where W. D. Taylor resided. Floyd Hartley, 231 South Bonnie Brae street, and L. A. Grant, in charge of the station, were in the place at the time. The circumstances recited by both of these witnesses tally to the minutest detail. The inquirer was 26 or 27 years old, they said, weighed about 165 pounds, wore a dark suit, probably of blue serge, and a light hat or cap. He had dark hair and was of medium complexion. They directed him to the Alvarado Terrace Apartments and he left the oil station. He walked toward the apartments. That was the last they saw of him. Maryland street runs east and west at the rear of Mr. Taylor's apartment. It is a street car stop on the West First-street car line, but passengers board cars there at only rare intervals, possibly not for months. E. W. Dascomb, conductor, and R. S. Woodard, motorman, stated that a man answering the description boarded their car at either 7:54 or 8:27 p.m. They were not certain which stop it was, but took notice because of the infrequency with which passengers are taken on the Maryland-street stop. "I took particular notice of this passenger on that account," said Conductor Dascomb. "It was an inbound trip. This fellow was about five feet and ten inches tall, fairly well dressed, as I remember, weighed about 165 pounds, and his hat or cap was of a light color. I remember that he wore something tan, but I don't recall whether it was his coat or vest. I can't remember where he got off, but I think I would know him again." Motorman Woodard recalled that Mr. Grant, in charge of the oil station, had mentioned the circumstances of a man inquiring for Mr. Taylor, and of the similarity in descriptions. The descriptions given by Mrs. MacLean, Mr. Woodward, and Mr. Dascomb tally so closely that authorities believe there is little doubt but what that three people saw the same man. It is believed that the slayer had no automobile. Persons residing in the vicinity have taken special notice of machines parked there "because the noise kept them awake," and they do not recall having seen any cars parked on Maryland street that night. This lends confirmation to the theory that the killer boarded a West First-street car. Mrs. J. H. Tander and her three sons reside directly across from Mr. Taylor's apartment at 360 South Alvarado Street. The occupants of the house were awake until after 9:30 p.m. and observed no automobile nor saw anyone loitering in the vicinity. Persons residing at 401 Westlake avenue, the house adjacent from Mr. Taylor's apartments, give similar information. Several hours were devoted yesterday to questioning Mabel Normand, well- known motion-picture actress and asserted fiancee of Mr. Taylor. Miss Normand is the last person thus far found who saw him alive. Her chauffeur, William Davis, also was questioned. Their stories were that Miss Normand left the Taylor apartments, 404-B South Alvarado street, at 7:45 p.m. Wednesday. Mr. Taylor accompanied her to the automobile. Immediately after checking up on this phase of the case the police started a search for the man Mrs. MacLean saw leaving the apartments between 7:45 and 7:50 p.m. soon after the report of a pistol shot was heard. While a search was under way for this man, the police also were making energetic efforts to find E. F. Sands, former secretary of Mr. Taylor, who was accused several months ago of forgery by the latter. Since a warrant was issued for the arrest of Sands on the asserted forgeries no trace of his whereabouts has been found. The tremendous resources of the Famous Players-Lasky organization were offered the police yesterday by Jesse L. Lasky, first vice-president of the company, for the capture of the assassin of the film director. Unlimited supply of money, time and effort was promised to the detectives, and every possible assistance will be given them by Mr. Taylor's friends and former associates, the officers were told. News of the murder stirred the motion-picture colony. Several intimate friends rushed to the home, among them being Mary Miles Minter, who became almost hysterical. The revenge and jealousy motive as a theory was strengthened by the fact that none of the valuables in the apartments or in Mr. Taylor's clothing was disturbed. About $78 in money was in his pocketbook, a two-carat diamond ring was not taken, and his platinum watch also was left. Detective Sergeants Herman Cline, Murphy, Cato, Cahill, Zeigler and Wallace, checked many clews. Among one of the leads furnished the police was a report that a man, eager to see Mr. Taylor, had inquired two days before at the Morosco Theater for his residence address, and insisted on getting it at once. The actions of this man aroused suspicion. An autopsy performed at the Ivy Overholtzer undertaking establishment showed that Mr. Taylor had been shot from the back with a .38-caliber revolver. Only one bullet was found. It entered on the left side toward the back about six inches under the arm pit. The course of the bullet indicated it had gone upwards and it was extracted in the fleshy part of the neck on the right side just below the ear. Both lobes of the left lung had been punctured. The nearest approach to an eyewitness account of the crime was furnished by Mrs. MacLean. About 7:45 p.m. she heard the shot and when she looked out the window she saw a man she described as roughly dressed, wearing a plaid cap, open the door of the Taylor apartment. The porch light was turned on, as were the lights in the rest of the house, she stated. This man paused as he came out of the door, looked around as if talking to some one inside and then left. He walked to an alley that leads to Maryland street, passing between Mr. Taylor's house and that of Mrs. MacLean. The murderer, it is believed, lurked in the shadows back to the Taylor flat and in the narrow alley between it and the garage, waiting for his opportunity. This theory of the police was reinforced last night by the discovery of six cigarette stubs in the immediate vicinity of the back door of the Taylor flat and in the alley facing the east windows of the murdered man's apartment. A maid at the MacLean home also said she heard some one lurking in the alley about 7:15 p.m. and heard the fatal shot about thirty minutes later. The man who smoked the cigarettes was very nervous. The half-smoked cigarettes show that. They were scattered around. One was barely touched. Evidently this one was the last one smoked by the man while waiting. It was found in the alley, leading the detectives to believe that the man threw it away almost immediately after lighting it, and that he watched Mr. Taylor leave the house. The back door of the Taylor flat opens on the sidewalk of the south side of Maryland street, just east of Alvarado. Between the east side of the structure where the Taylor flat is located and the garage used by occupants of the flats in the court is a narrow, cement-paved alley. This alley, too, leads into Maryland street. A large tree affords ample protection from the light on Alvarado street at night, blocks the view of the house. It is in the shadow of this tree, the officers believe, that the murderer lay in wait, smoking his cigarettes. More than half a dozen of matches were found on the lawn between the curb of Maryland street and the back window of the Taylor flat. The opportunity for him to enter the house came, the police believe, when Mr. Taylor escorted Miss Normand to her automobile. During the few minutes required for this, the murderer slipped into the open door and waited behind it for the return of Mr. Taylor, the officers think. Mrs. MacLean, who knows Sands, stated the man who left the Taylor apartment did not look familiar to her. The investigators, however, have not relaxed their efforts to find Sands in order to question him in the hope he may be able to aid them in solving the mystery. Mr. Taylor left the Famous Players-Lasky studio, where he was a director, at 4:30 p.m., Wednesday, according to Barrett Keisling, publicity man. From the story related by Henry Peavey, negro, houseman, who found the body, Mr. Taylor came immediately home, ate dinner and was visited by Miss Normand. Los Angeles and New York film colonies were deeply affected by the news of the murder. Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle, awaiting the verdict in his manslaughter trial in San Francisco, said: "Mr. Taylor's death comes as a great shock to me. We were good friends and never a whisper of scandal arouse about him. He was one of the finest fellows on the 'lot.'" Detective Sergts. Cline, Wynn and Murphy questioned several friends of Mr. Taylor late last night in an effort to obtain any information that may aid in solving the mystery. Detective Sergeants Cato and Cahill, both personal friends of Mr. Taylor, left the police station late last night to question a former sweetheart of Mr. Taylor. They declined to divulge her name. Mary Miles Minter, who was directed in several plays by Mr. Taylor and who holds high regard for him, declared yesterday she could think of no enemies or persons who would have a motive in killing him. She denied reports she had ever been engaged to marry him, saying she was extremely sorry she never had been, because she admired him greatly as a man.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1992 LOS ANGELES TIMES Man Who Found Body is Sought in Police CourtWhile the police were endeavoring to solve the mystery of who murdered William D.

Taylor. She gave a clear and frank statement of all her movements Wednesday afternoon and evening. J. A. Waldron, the Mack Sennett studio manager, was with her all day, answering phone calls and receiving messages, Miss Normand stated. Continuing, she stated that she spent the afternoon downtown, attending principally to income tax matters and to her banking. She then called her home from the bank at Sixth and Main streets and asked if there were any messages for her. Her maid said: "Mr. Taylor has been trying to get you all the afternoon, and we told him that you were out. We told him you were downtown." "He had been trying to get some books for me that I wanted," said Miss Normand. "We always discussed books a great deal. He told the maid he had got one of the books at Parker's and was sending it by his chauffeur. He said that he had obtained the other book I wanted at Robinson's, and left word with the maid for me to stop at his house and get it. "I went and bought 5 cents worth of peanuts, but the man didn't have any change; so I went to the drug store in the Pacific Electric Building and got the change. I bought a lot of magazines and papers, among others a Police Gazette. I ate the peanuts on the way, and we drove out to Mr. Taylor's, and when I got out I told my chauffeur to clean the car. Then I went up on the steps. I heard Mr. Taylor talking to somebody over the phone, underneath the stairs, and I hesitated about going in until he had finished. Then I entered. He had been talking to Mrs. Marjorie Berger, who has charge of the income tax business for many of the picture folk, including myself. "He came in and said, 'Gee, I am glad to see you.' I said, 'I just came up for the book.' "I arrived at his house about five minutes after 7. We talked about books. I looked around his drawing-room, and told him I thought he had changed his house furnishings. He said, 'You haven't been here for so long you forgot.' I hadn't been to his house before in two months. He said, 'The Victrola is the only thing new.' "His servant, Henry, had been arrested for some sort of misconduct, and he was saying that perhaps he would have to go down to court tomorrow (that's today) to see about it. Henry came in, and I said to Mr. Taylor, 'Have you had your dinner?' He said, 'Yes, have you had yours?' I said, 'No, but I am tired, and I'm going home now. I have a studio call for 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.' I've been going to bed very early every night--haven't been anywhere since I began work on my present picture. "We were talking about the cameraman's ball next Saturday night, and he said he had a box, and I said I had one. He told me whom he was going to take and wanted to know whom I was going to take. "Henry went out and talked to my chauffeur as my chauffeur cleaned up the car. Henry was telling my chauffeur what a nice man Taylor was to work for. "Finally Mr. Taylor said 'Well, if you're tired why don't you go home and rest and I will call you up this evening.' I asked Mr. Taylor who lived in the different bungalows in the court, and he told me. We stood outside two or three minutes talking. He had left his door open. He put me in the car, and as he saw the peanut shells, and the pile of books, he laughed and said: 'Here you are with Nietzsche under one arm and Freud under the other and the Police Gazette close by. You certainly are going in for heavy reading this winter.' I said, 'Yes, I wish I could get hold of Joe Miller's Joke Book: that would complete the set.' Then he said 'Good-night, I will call you up in about an hour.' "I went home, had my dinner at once and was in bed and asleep by 8 o'clock. I didn't have to go to the studio this morning because there was something the matter with the set. "Edna Purviance called me up this morning and said 'Have you heard the terrible news? William D. Taylor's valet is running up and down the court screaming he is dead. They say he died of heart failure.' Afterward I learned that he had been murdered. "I hear that Mr. Taylor told Mrs. Berger he wished that he had called off the warrant he had against Sands. I understand that he felt apprehensive of harm from him. There were, I hear, all sorts of mysterious telephone calls and all that. Sands was one of those servile human beings, apparently all devotion to Mr. Taylor." Miss Normand says that Edward Knoblock had Mr. Taylor's house while Mr. Taylor was in Europe last summer and that Mr. Taylor had Mr. Knoblock's London house. Sands apparently stayed right along in Mr. Taylor's service in Los Angeles, and also assisted Mr. Knoblock. Two or three days before Mr. Taylor was to arrive from London, Sands told Mr. Knoblock that he thought he would take two or three days leave of absence, but would be back soon. He never showed up again. When Mr. Taylor arrived from London, he said he found that Sands had stolen everything, had forged his name to checks and had gone to Hamburger's and bought lingerie. He had a sweetheart here. Miss Normand doesn't know who she was. A few weeks ago Mr. Taylor's house was robbed again. Then from Stockton he kept getting anonymous letters, and he received a pawnbroker's ticket, showing that things had been pawned in the name of a Mrs. Tennant [sic], who is Mr. Taylor's sister-in-law. The way Mr. Taylor knew it was really Sands was because he had always spelled Mrs. Tennent's name wrong, and the wrong spelling was on the ticket. "Mr. Taylor knew that Sands wasn't out of California by this fact," said Miss Normand. Mrs. Marjorie Burger [sic] said that Mr. Taylor had told her often that he had been getting mysterious phone calls. He talked so funny, saying that he had wished sometimes that he had dropped prosecution. Mrs. Burger said: "Why don't you get somebody to watch?" But he said, "Oh, no." As for Mabel Normand's reported engagement to Mr. Taylor: she said, "We have always been great friends. We love to talk over books and that sort of thing. He's the sort of man who can come to the house, sit and read while I play the piano, and talk informally over our work and over our books." Mabel Normand admitted that Mr. Taylor had asked her to marry him, but that phase of the friendship had been over for some time. They were just good pals, she said. Miss Normand and Mr. Taylor were seen out together a great deal at one time; but of late they have hardly seen each other at all, she said.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 3, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES First Murder Theory Advanced By Police Assailant Entered Home as Taylor Left for Moment, is Belief.The first theory of the murder of William D. Taylor, motion-picture director, evolved by the detectives assigned to the case, was as follows: Mr. Taylor, just finishing his dinner, was visited by Mabel Normand. They discussed a scenario and several other matters relating to motion pictures. Some time shortly after 7 p.m. Henry Peavey, negro houseman employed by Taylor, left the apartments for the night, leaving Mr. Taylor and Miss Normand. About 7:45 p.m., Miss Normand left the apartment, according to her statement. She was accompanied to her automobile at the curbing by Mr. Taylor. Her negro [sic] chauffeur was waiting for her and drove her home, which she reached about 8 o'clock. It was during this absence from the house by Mr. Taylor that his slayer entered the apartment through the door that had been left open, the theory goes. When Mr. Taylor entered the door on his return he was immediately attacked, being shot from the back, probably as he closed the door. The assailant left immediately. The shot was heard about 7:45 p.m., according to the account given by Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of Douglas MacLean, motion-picture actor. Her maid also heard the report. Mrs. MacLean went to the door of her apartment and saw a man leaving by the front door of Mr. Taylor's home. He closed the door and looked around back of him. Then he walked between the Taylor house and the one adjacent on the west [sic], going north by the side entrance to Maryland street. The description of this man was given to the officers, indicating he was an American, medium height, but heavily built, and wore a plaid cap.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 3, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Houseman Tells of Discovery Incidents Leading Up to Tragedy Related by Man Who Lauds Dead Master.Henry Peavey had been employed about six months by Mr. Taylor as houseman and valet. He never slept in the house, leaving after the dinner, if his master ate at home and returning the next morning. "I had turned back the covers on Mr. Taylor's bed, put some ice water on the table and finished the supper things," Peavey related. "The income tax lady called on the telephone, and then Miss Normand arrived in her automobile. They sat in rocking chairs and talked about some book. Mr. Taylor was always reading books. He sometimes told me he had read until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. Once when he was making a picture he showed me a pile of books, and said, 'I've got to read all these.' "Well, I motioned to Mr. Taylor and he said, 'You may go now, Henry.' That was about 7:30 o'clock. On the way to work in the morning I stopped at a drug store and got a bottle of milk of magnesia. I often got that for Mr. Taylor. I'd just buy it with my own money and every once in a while tell him how much I had spent. He was a good man. He never asked me what I had spent money for; just how much I had spent to keep him comfortable. As soon as I opened the door I saw his feet. I said, 'Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor.' Then I peeped in and saw his face, and I knew something had happened. I started to yell and all the people in the court came out. I ran to the landlord. No, sir, I didn't go into the house. No, sir. "Mr. Taylor had few friends call. I can only remember his having people for dinner two or three times since I have been with him. At night he would stay home and read. He went out little and drank very little. He was a very good man."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 3, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Servant Finds Body on Floor Steel Bullet Overlooked in First Examination Mabel Normand Says She Left Early in Evening. Overturned Chair is Only Evidence of Struggle.The discovery of the murder of William Desmond Taylor was made about 7:30 a.m. yesterday when Henry Peavey, colored house man employed by Taylor, came to work. Peavey says he opened the front door and was first attracted by the body lying on the floor of the living-room, when he saw Mr. Taylor's feet. The body was feet toward the door and over the legs was a chair that apparently had been overturned. Peavey declares he called to his employer and then decided he was dead. "I ran from the house, " Peavey said, "and the folks around here say I made a commotion. The neighbors came running and later they took the body away." Peavey last saw Mr. Taylor alive Wednesday night about 7:30 o'clock, he said. He had prepared dinner for him and just as he was serving dessert, Mabel Normand, well-known film actress and said by friends to have been his fiancee, came to see Mr. Taylor. This visit began about 7 o'clock, Peavey stated. When he left the home at 7:30 p.m., Miss Normand was still there. A physician was called and at first it was believed the death was of natural causes, probably brought about by a hemorrhage. It was not until a considerable time after the remains were taken to the Ivy Overholtzer undertaking establishment that discovery was made that Mr. Taylor had been shot. The wound was in the back, entering at the left side in a line under the heart. A steel jacketed bullet apparently had been used and the wound had practically closed up thus making detection at first difficult. Peavey said he had been in the employ of Mr. Taylor for about six months. Mr. Taylor had lived in the apartments at the Alvarado courts about two years. The scene left in the magnificently appointed apartment occupied by Mr. Taylor showed little signs of a struggle. The overturned chair was the only indication of a struggle or of the haste of the assailant to escape. The door, which has a night latch, was locked from the outside, but the latch was set so that no key was necessary to accomplish this. A writing desk was situated near the door, against the front wall of the room. On this desk were many papers indicating that Mr. Taylor had been preparing his income tax return for this year and adjusting other business. Some scenarios also were scattered about. On top of the desk was a picture of Mabel Normand. In a place of honor on the top of the upright piano was a photograph of Miss Normand. Three, in all, were conspicuously displayed. Photographs of many persons known throughout the world as film stars also were displayed in the rooms of the apartment. About the border of the living room and dining-room Mr. Taylor had placed a solid border of autographed and framed photographs. Among them were pictures of Mary Pickford, whom he had directed in three pictures before enlisting in the World War. On this picture was written, "To my nice director, William Taylor, the most patient man that I know, with sincere friendship, Mary Pickford." In a prominent place was Mary Miles Minter's photograph. This bore the following expression of admiration: "For William Desmond Taylor, Artist, gentleman, man! Sincere good wishes, Mary Miles Minter, 1920." Soon after the news of the murder had spread, Mary Miles Minter and her mother rushed to the house to see if they could be of any aid. Miss Minter declared that Mabel Normand had been engaged for about six months to Mr. Taylor. The grief of Miss Minter was shown by the tears which she shed while viewing the scene where her friend had been shot. Later in the morning Frank O'Connor, formerly an assistant director under Mr. Taylor and for many years a close friend, visited the apartments. He sounded high praise for Mr. Taylor. Charles Eyton, general manager of the Lasky studio, was present when the undertaker removed the valuables from the person of Mr. Taylor. L. P. Waterman, deputy public administrator, was called and assumed charge of the property. Detective Sergeants Zeigler and Wallis, assigned to the case when the first report of the death was made to the police, interviewed Miss Normand and obtained a statement from her, they reported, that she had left the apartment some time around 8 o'clock. She was not sure of the time, but placed it at approximately 7:45 p.m. In the court where Mr. Taylor lived there are sixteen apartments. It is composed of eight two-story white stucco buildings. E. C. Jessurun, proprietor of the court, responded to the alarm raised by the negro houseman.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 3, 1922 PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER Los Angeles, Calif., Feb. 2.--Rumors of a mystery death plot against motion picture higher-ups in Los Angeles flew thick and fast through the Hollywood screen colony today following the finding of William Desmond Taylor, aged 50, noted British film director of the Famous Players-Lasky Company, murdered in his bungalow. These rumors were given strength by the fact that recently Paul Kramer, another well-known director of the Brunton Studios, was shot five times from ambush by a mysterious assassin...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 3, 1922 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE Women Feature Film Murder Director Slain Mysteriously in Movie City Crime Brings to Light Romances With Beautiful Picture Stars Three Visited House Slayer Believed in Hiding as Mabel Normand Was With W. D. TaylorLos Angeles, Feb. 2--In the numerous romances of William Desmond Taylor with the beautiful women in Hollywood's movie colony, the police are seeking a clew to lead them to his assassin. Names famous in movieland are being linked with the story of the tragedy. The mystery of the slaying and the stories of gallantries in which Taylor is the hero, overshadow any of those pictured in the film studios where he was one of the moving spirits. Three women movie stars are known to have visited his luxurious bungalow at 404B South Alvarado street, where his body was found this morning, within a few hours of the time he must have died. The slayer now is believed to have been hiding near the bungalow while Mabel Normand was with Taylor, a period of perhaps two hours. When Taylor left the house to escort Miss Normand, the slayer is believed to have slipped into the house, to lurk there until the chance came to end the life of the man he hated. Another actress of national repute went to the house about two hours later, the detectives have been told. What was the purpose or the result of her visit has not been disclosed as yet. At the time of her visit, according to the opinion of physicians, Taylor had been dead for nearly two hours. The police seek an answer to the double-barreled question: "What did this beautiful actress go to see, and what did she see?" An hour later Edna Purviance, a next door neighbor and long time friend of Taylor, reached her home. She saw a light in Taylor's study and rang his bell. There was no answer. She told the police she decided he was out or did not wish visitors, so she went to her own home. With these facts for a background and stories of Taylor's love affairs, gleaned in the studios, the police have subordinated but not abandoned the possibility that the hand of a woman scorned by Taylor fired the shot. They are concentrating on tracking down the shadowy unknown who lurked around the bungalow and, as they believe, dodged in, killed Taylor and escaped. One witness says she saw a man dressed in dark clothing and wearing a checkered cap, standing at the partly opened door of Taylor's bungalow and peering in. The housemaid of another neighbor saw a man running through an alley back of the house shortly after the report of a revolver was heard. This noise was ascribed at the time to an automobile blowout, but detectives are not satisfied it was the shot that ended Taylor's life. The unidentified man is described as roughly dressed. This may be a ruse to throw the police off the track of the slayer. Where men and women make their fortunes by impersonation, in the studios it is not improbable that they might resort to the expedient of a disguise to carry out a plan of vengeance. Whether the slayer, if it was a man who killed Taylor, acted in jealous rage because of attentions to a woman with whom he was infatuated, or did the bidding of a furious woman who later crept to the bungalow and peered, white- faced, upon the scene of the tragedy before slipping away again, are elements of the problem that face the investigators. These are all details they hope to bring to light in following through the maze through which Taylor passed in his endless search for beauty and which led him finally to his death. He was 50 years old. Beauty was the dominating impulse of his career. He sought for the beautiful in his pictures. It was this which brought him fame as the chief director of the Famous Players-Lasky corporation. It was his selection that brought the most beautiful of actresses into the pictures he directed. ...Taylor was a high liver and had many women friends. He was, according to general opinion in the motion picture colony, engaged for a time to Mary Miles Minter and later to Mabel Normand. A Mrs. Paul A. Crawford Ivers, continuity editor for Lasky's, is also reported to have been a friend of his. Taylor had been married twice, having been divorced both times. He was pre-eminently a man who kept the greater part of his life a mystery to those about him. Few men knew very much about his business interests which in a purely investment way and aside from his large earnings as chief motion picture director for the largest producing concern in the world, were extensive. Similarly he was a man of decided attraction for woman, but one who, in affairs of the heart as in everything else, played without making any noise...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 3, 1922 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE Movie Murder Case Theories Involve WomenLos Angeles, Feb. 2--Detectives seeking a solution to the mysterious slaying of William Desmond Taylor are considering the following theories: 1--A woman, jealous of a rival, killed him. 2--A jealous woman sent a hired assassin or an infatuated admirer to kill him. 3--A jealous suitor of a woman who favored Taylor killed him. 4--A forger killed him to destroy evidence of his crime from among the checks Taylor was sorting. 5--A robber slipped into the house and, surprised by Taylor's return, killed him and fled because he feared to stop for loot. 6--A former servant accused by him of criminal acts killed him for revenge. 7--An aspirant for movie honors, rejected by Taylor, killed him. 8--A woman, to make sure Taylor never would reveal her secret, killed him or had him killed. The investigators, weighing all the evidence, incline to one of the first three possibilities.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 3, 1922 SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER Los Angeles, Feb. 2...Because of the variance in the descriptions of the man Mrs. MacLean saw and Sands, the police are inclined to drop any suspicion of this former valet, and they likewise place little credence in the robbery theory, as no material facts seem to support such a possibility. But some woman, they believe, is at the apex of the triangle, the other two points of which are a man with a revolver and William Desmond Taylor, noted Lasky director (deceased)...********************************************************************************************************************************************************** COMMENTARY:1. There was some discrepancy in the initial press reports concerning the time of Mabel Normand's visit and the shot heard by the MacLeans. But it was ultimately concluded that Mabel Normand's visit had been between approximately 7:00 and 7:45 p.m., and Taylor was shot within a few minutes after her departure.2. One report quoted Mabel as stating Taylor was on the phone with Marjorie Berger when Mabel arrived. But in other interviews, including her statement to the District Attorney, she stated she had no knowledge about who was on the phone with Taylor. Based on the statements made by Marjorie Berger and Antonio Moreno, it appears that Taylor was on the phone with Moreno at the time Mabel arrived.3. The shot which killed Taylor entered his left side and traveled upward, coming to rest in the right side of his neck, just below the surface of the skin, but breaking the surface and causing bleeding from his neck. It was initially thought that the exit wound was the entrance wound, and that Taylor had been shot in the neck. But the autopsy proved otherwise. Likewise, Taylor had not been shot in the heart.4. One newspaper quoted Mabel Normand as stating he had a premonition of something wrong. In a subsequent interview, Mabel denied having made that statement, and it appeared that the reporter took a comment made by Marjorie Berger and attributed it to Mabel.5. Taylor's body was found with a chair astride his legs, but the chair was not overturned, contrary to some press reports. A diagram of the murder scene and a reconstruction of the position of the body by the first person to enter the apartment, both indicated that the chair was not overturned.6. Some reports stated that Edna Purviance knocked on Taylor's door late at night, but she subsequently denied it, and her most detailed statement in the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER makes no mention of it. It appears that a reporter was again attempting to add some drama by having Edna ring Taylor's bell while his body was just a few feet away.7. The bullet which killed Taylor was variously reported to have been .32 or .38 caliber, steel-nosed or lead. The final report indicated the bullet was .38 caliber and lead.8. Press reports stated that Mary Miles Minter was accompanied by her mother when she went to the murder scene on February 2. However her own statements plus the statement of the Shelby chauffeur indicates it was her grandmother, Julia Miles, who accompanied Mary. Mary always called her grandmother "Mamma", and that is probably the reason why reporters assumed her mother was the person accompanying her.9. The initial report that Taylor had given Mabel a book of Freud was later changed to either "Rosa Mundi" by Ethel Dell or that book plus a German translation of Nietzsche. In her detailed 1927 interview she stated that she had her volume of Freud with her at the time, but the two other books were the ones given to her by Taylor. It seems probable that when she mentioned Taylor's joke contrasting the volume of Freud to the Police Gazette, that a reporter erroneously assumed the volume of Freud was the book Taylor just gave her.10.Taylor had been married and divorced just once, not twice.11.Some press reports indicated that Christine Jewett, the MacLean's maid, stated that she heard a man pacing "in a rear alley running between the two houses" (the MacLean house and the Taylor house), which would indicate that the man was pacing at the side of the MacLean house. But in a later direct interview, the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (February 22, 1922) reported: "On the night of the murder, says Miss Jewett, she heard a man in the alley which runs back of the MacLean house. He was there from fifteen to twenty minutes. 'Mr. MacLean came home about five minutes past 7,' she said. 'He honked his car horn to notify me that I could begin serving dinner. He then came into the house. I served the first course and returned to the screen porch, on which there were blinds. Shortly afterwards I first heard the man. He was walking in the alley. Suddenly he stopped and for a long time stood perfectly still. I listened, fearing auto thieves. Then Mrs. MacLean rang the bell and I had to go back to the dining room. When I finished serving the second course I returned to the porch. The man was moving around then. I heard his shoes scrape on the pavement. He continued, at intervals, to move and to stand still. Between 7:45 and 8 o'clock I heard a shot.'" That statement seems to indicate that the man was pacing in the alley behind the MacLean home, not at the side.12.The LOS ANGELES TIMES tries to make much of some cigarettes and matches found near the back door and the east side of Taylor's flat. However, this is not where the man was pacing behind or next to the MacLean flat, and it seems probable that the cigarettes and matches were the result of reporters or bystanders who were evicted from the Taylor flat after the discovery that Taylor had been murdered, and who were milling around outside of the flat.13.Mabel Normand was notified of Taylor's death by a telephone call from Edna Purviance.********************************************************************************************************************************************************** Back issues of Taylorology are available on the Web at any of the following: http://www.angelfire.com/az/Taylorology/ http://www.etext.org/Zines/ASCII/Taylorology/ http://www.silent-movies.com/Taylorology/ Full text searches of back issues can be done at http://www.etext.org/Zines/ or at http://www.silent-movies.com/search.html.
