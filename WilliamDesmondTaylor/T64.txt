***************************************************************************** Mabel Normand and "Goldwyn"

We finally got around to reading GOLDWYN, by A. Scott Berg. It's a very nice book, but there is a major omission regarding the initial founding of Goldwyn Pictures. Samuel Goldfish was forced out of Famous Players-Lasky on September 14,
1916. Goldwyn Pictures was incorporated two months later on November 19,
1916. That was in Berg's book. But why would the Selwyns agree to Goldfish's plan and join with him to create Goldwyn Pictures? Goldfish needed the Selwyns, with their reputation and library of filmable plays; but why did the Selwyns need Goldfish? What did Goldfish have that the Selwyns couldn't get elsewhere? The primary answer: Mabel Normand. On September 16, 1916, two days after resigning from Famous Players- Lasky, Sam Goldfish signed Mabel Normand to a personal contract, to take effect after her current contract with Sennett would expire in 1917. A few months earlier, MOTION PICTURE MAGAZINE had a readers' poll and Mabel Normand was voted the favorite female comedian, with nearly two million votes. So at the time Goldfish was negotiating with the Selwyns, he had Mabel Normand's contract in his pocket; he had the top female comedy star, and if the Selwyns wanted her they would have to do business with him. Indeed, given the circumstances described in Berg's book surrounding the formation of Goldwyn Pictures, it seems unlikely that Goldfish would have been able to convince the Selwyns, had he not had Mabel Normand under contract. (See NEW YORK TELEGRAPH, July 8, 1917, reprinted in MABEL NORMAND: A SCOURCE BOOK TO HER LIFE AND FILMS, p. 56.) So Mabel Normand was not only the most successful star of Goldwyn Pictures, she was a major impetus for its very existence.

Another Taylor Film on Home Video?

The 1917 film "A Tale of Two Cities," starring William Farnum, is available on home video from Critics' Choice. Taylor seems to have had something to do with this film, based on the following:
1. In several contemporary motion picture directories and items of personal publicity, it was stated that Taylor had either directed this film, or acted in it.
2. Taylor joined Fox in December 1916, and was there when "A Tale of Two Cities" was being filmed.
3. The film had a "cast of thousands" and likely utilized almost everyone on the Fox lot at the time. On the other hand: Taylor was not in the cast listing; the "director of record" was Frank Lloyd; and the star William Farnum stated that he had never worked with Taylor. Without firm proof, the following are some possibilities:
1. Perhaps Taylor did some work on the film as a second unit director, to help with the big crowd scenes, or to direct some minor scenes while Frank Lloyd was directing the star.
2. Perhaps Taylor acted in a small uncredited role.
3. Perhaps Frank Lloyd was ill for a few days, and Taylor took over temporarily. The exact answer will probably never be known. But "A Tale of Two Cities," made while Taylor was on the Fox lot, probably contains a little of his work.

***************************************************************************** In Print: "The Big Book of Scandal!"

THE BIG BOOK OF SCANDAL! (Paradox Press, 1997) is a 191-page large paperback covering the major American scandals of the past century. Written by Jonathan Vankin and illustrated in a wide variety of comic book styles by "over 50 of the world's top artists," the book includes "Death of a Mystery Man," a four-page recap of the Taylor case illustrated by Alan Weiss. For a short, sensationalized recap of the case, it is fairly good--although, as would be expected, some rumors are stated as fact. The only major error in the recap was the path and distance of the fatal shot. The book's bibliography indicates that Vankin utilized three issues of TAYLOROLOGY (issues 15, 19, and 50) in addition to HOLLYWOOD BABYLON and the books by Kirkpatrick and Giroux. This is the first time we have seen electronic TAYLOROLOGY cited as a bibliographic source in print. Thanks Jonathan!

Reporting the Taylor Murder: Day Five

Below are some highlights of the press reports published in the fifth day after Taylor's body was discovered.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

February 6, 1922 Wallace Smith DENVER POST Los Angeles, Feb. 6--...More and more the eyes of the detectives are turned to the haunts of the Hollywood drug peddlers, the smugglers of forbidden "dope" who cater to the depravities of the wild movie set. More and more they feel certain that sooner or later the secret of the shooting must come, directly or indirectly, from the dens of these human birds of prey. It was this theory that led to the apprehension of the three men rounded up last night as suspects. They were directed in their search for the trio by a mysterious, anonymous informant. One of the trio was an actor once employed by Taylor. He had given up the rather unprofitable business of the stage for bootlegging, and later gave this up for the infinitely more simple and profitable peddling of drugs. After Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of the picture star, had failed to identify either of the three as the man she asserts she saw leaving Taylor's home about the time of the murder and after they had supplied likely alibis, they were released. Make no mistake about the open handed operations of the drug ring in the wilds of Hollywood. It sounds melodramatic and perhaps smacks of an attempt at sensationalism. Regardless of sound or smack, it is an ever present and ever growing menace, almost unbelievable in the boldness with which it is carried on. One of the present theories of the police is that Taylor, alias William Deane-Tanner, the man of the double life and friend of many women, was receiving the "dope" for one of his feminine acquaintances. It was rather definitely reported that she was a star whose friends had sought to keep her favorite "dope," morphine, away from her and that she had found in Taylor a willing agent. One of her admirers, it was theorized, learning that Taylor had been secretly holding the young woman a slave to the drug--and perhaps to his fancies--confronted him with the fact and killed him. The actual developments in the past few hours of the sensational case were: The frantic search for letters written by Mabel Normand, with Taylor an hour before he was slain, to the director--letters which have disappeared from the bureau drawer in which he secreted them. The disappearance of a dainty, peach colored silk nightgown, frilled with lace, and said to bear the monogram of one of the leading stars of the profession. One report placed this in the possession of an investigator who was said to have a private use for it, another said that it had been recovered by some agent of the star. The discovery of other letters from other stars--including the notes of Blanche Sweet and Gloria Swanson; friendly little notes--among the private papers of the slain director. The fact that a rich ne-er-do-well of Los Angeles, a man of wealth and influence and an unsavory reputation, was being kept under surveillance by the detectives. The suspicion that a man recently risen to fame in the screen world, inspired by mad jealousy, had killed the director. He, too, was to be asked to account for his whereabouts the night of the slaying. In all their huntings and scurrying around the detectives did not for a moment lose sight of their theory that the killer may have been a blackmailer, who shot his victim when the payer of tribute finally turned and defied him. This, in consideration of Taylor's tangled past and his numerous affairs with women, still seemed the most likely theory... The search for the peach-hued "nighties" promised to become interesting. With blackmail already in the air, the owner of the garment might feel a bit apprehensive about having it fall into the hands of one who might find in it a weapon for levying tribute. That it had disappeared was revealed after Peavey, the house man, had spoken of putting it carefully away a few nights before his employer was slain. That it had been in Taylor's possession, at all, gave new color to the stories of the affairs with women conducted by the man who was known to his friends as "a man's man," and one who "always played a lone hand." These same friends, surprised as they were by the news that Taylor had been married, was a father and a wife-deserter, have with stubborn regard for the ethics of friendship, refused to discuss the private affairs of the man who is dead. Which may be fine for the ethics of friendship, but which is making it rather difficult for the police, who are seeking the friend's slayer. It is also giving rise to rumors about the abuse of strength being manifested by the moving picture interests in "hushing up" all tales which might in some way reflect on the actors and actresses--even those whose dissipations are notorious and matters of every-day gossip. It has even been hinted that if there is any money to be raised it will not be for the purpose of finding the man who killed Taylor, but for the purpose of "hushing up" those who might assist in capturing the assassin. Meanwhile, the mad "parties" in Hollywood continue. Some of the wilder ones may be a little quiet for a week, or so, but only rarely, they learned, is there any telling investigation. And so they will be at it again...

February 6, 1922 DENVER POST ...Mrs. Theodore Brown, of the Brown-Byers studio, knew William Desmond Taylor very well about six years ago in Los Angeles. "Billy Taylor was one of the finest men I ever met," Mrs. Brown said Monday. "He used to come to our house and call on Neva Gerber, a motion picture actress who was staying with us, and who now lives at 217 North Western avenue, Los Angeles. He and Miss Gerber were engaged to be married, but about two years ago they decided not to go on with their engagement..."

February 6, 1922 MILWAUKEE JOURNAL Jealous Suitor Seen as Hand on Death Gun

Los Angeles, Feb. 6--The little green-eyed monster, jealousy, police and private detectives say, has directed search for a prominent young New Yorker, formerly engaged to one of the beautiful stars of filmdom, in connection with the mystery murder last Wednesday night of William Desmond Taylor, widely known motion picture director, known in New York prior to 1908 as William Cunningham Deane-Tanner, art connoisseur. For sustained interest and thrilling denouement after denouement, the case continues to project itself farther and farther above any film mystery which the genius of the director ever developed for the theatergoer. Letters written by Mabel Normand to Taylor, reported missing following the murder, and evidence concerning presence for six months at least of a woman's silk pink nightgown, embroidered with a screen star's initials, in the luxuriously appointed bachelor apartment, and its disappearance after the slaying, add considerable interest to the case. The New Yorker suspected in connection with the murder is reported to have checked out of a hotel there on the day of the murder and to have left the city the following afternoon. He is believed by investigators to have headed for San Diego and possibly crossed the border into Mexico. His name is withheld by police. The actress to whom this suspect was once engaged, according to investigators, was a close friend to Taylor and in this friendship a possible motive of jealousy which would lead to murder is seen. The probe daily goes deeper and deeper into the motion picture colony here, and the great list of names of actresses and actors, as well as managers and employees, being questioned by the police begins to read like a list of those present at a great "movie" ball. One of the tangles in the Hollywood skein, police say, concerns a widely- known actress and a man said to be enamored of her. This actress, they say, was frank in expressing admiration of Taylor, and it is known he saw much of her. Here, police say, is one possible clew to the "jealousy" theory. They say, however, that while extremely anxious to question the man, they find it a delicate matter, owing to the resources and friends he possesses... With the tales came to the police of the alleged possession by Taylor of women's silken lingerie, one piece of which, a pink nightrobe, is reported missing from his apartments since his body was discovered. One witness is said to have stated, but not to the police, that this robe bore the embroidered initials of a motion picture actress. Close upon the heels of these declarations came the report that the police were searching for a drug peddler, who, it is pointed out, had sought through Taylor to make deliver of drugs to an actress, who found it difficult to make her purchases direct. The initials of the actress connected with this phase of the case were said to be the same as those on the night robe reported missing from the Taylor apartments. Police are looking for the silk nightgown, Captain of Detectives David L. Adams said. "We have never seen it," he said. "We have had a lot of reports about it, and if it existed it has disappeared. We have had no definite reports that it belonged to any actress or woman. We do not know that it had any initials upon it, or other marks of identification, but we are going to look for it." After the announcement of the search for the drug peddler, deputy sheriffs left for an unnamed destination on what they termed the "most definite clew thus far discovered in the Taylor murder mystery." They said they were going to interview "a certain party" and possibly make an arrest. This was the first active participation of the sheriff's forces in the case. Miss Mabel Normand, the motion picture actress, who was with Taylor shortly before he was shot and killed in his home here last Wednesday evening, Sunday stated that a package of letters written by her to Taylor at different times was missing from his home. Miss Normand said the letters were there a few weeks ago. The letters, she said, were friendly in tone and there was "nothing in them to be ashamed of," but she was unable to account for their disappearance. The detectives placed much weight on this development, saying it was the first real sign of an indication pointing to a possible motive for the shooting.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

February 6, 1922 LOS ANGELES RECORD ...The shot that killed William Desmond Taylor was fired from a distance of only three or four inches. This startling discovery in the murder mystery was announced following a conference at police headquarters today between the officers investigating the crime. It was revealed when Detective Sergeant Edward King, detailed to duty at the district attorney's office, brought to the conference the clothing of the murdered movie director. Powder burns on the tan gabardine coat indicated that the revolver was held by the assassin almost against Taylor's body. Experiments in the police shooting gallery, where shots were fired at a similar piece of cloth from varying distances, confirmed the surmise that the muzzle of the revolver could not have been more than 4 inches from Taylor's coat when the fatal shot was fired. This discovery leads to two speculations. Number One: (Which is not considered seriously by the police,) is that Taylor killed himself. But no weapon was found by the body. The only conclusion reconcilable with this hypothesis is that the body was discovered by a burglar, who had entered the apartment and who was frightened away after picking up the revolver. Number Two: Taylor might have engaged in a desperate struggle with his assassin before he was killed, and that they were at death grips when the murderer pulled out his weapon and fired. This speculation is born out by the overturned chair found across the dead man's feet. But nothing else in the room had been disturbed however. If Taylor saw his slayer and grappled with him, it is believed that he must have recognized him as an enemy. This belief leads to the abandonment of the burglar theory and the concentration of every effort upon finding an ancient enemy of the murdered picture director--some one perhaps who knew him in the old days in New York, before he changed his name from Tanner to Taylor. ...Today's activities by the police followed a night of fruitless endeavor to solve the murder mystery by detectives and deputy sheriffs, outstanding in the night's work was the detention and grilling of two well- known movie actors. In overcoat and muffler, with a cap pulled down over his forehead, George Milo, picture actor, strode up and down the sidewalk last night in front of 404-B South Alvarado street, the bungalow home of Taylor. He was enacting, against his will, a role he had often played for profit in the films--that of a "genteel heavy." Eyes unseen by him looked out from the shuttered windows of the bungalow across the court from Taylor's. Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of the movie star, was comparing Milo with the man she saw leaving the bungalow where Taylor was murdered. Meanwhile, in a closed automobile, parked a short distance away deputy sheriffs were firing questions at Henri Reineque, actor and friend of Milo. The questions concerned his whereabouts and that of the other film actor last Wednesday night. Milo and Reineque were taken into custody at 8 o'clock last night as they were alighting from Milo's automobile in front of the Lobban apartments, 1030 West Eighth street, where both live. Al Manning, chief deputy in charge of criminal investigations at the sheriff's office, drove to the Lobban with Deputy Sheriff Harvey Bell. They had traced Milo's automobile after a mysterious telephone message had been received at the sheriff's office to the effect that a Maxwell sedan with a certain number stood in front of Taylor's home the night of the murder. The number given by the anonymous informant was that of Milo's closed Maxwell. "The boss wants to see you," explained Manning, accosting the men. "Who's the boss?" asked one. "The sheriff," replied Bell. The two actors made no protest as they were escorted to the sheriff's automobile and taken to the office. Here they were separated and both subjected to a severe grilling on the question of their whereabouts Wednesday night. Milo at first seemed worried by the questions. "You were a close acquaintance of Mabel Normand, weren't you?" demanded one of the five or six deputies who surrounded him with a circle of accusing eyes. "No," replied Milo. "I worked with her in 'The Slim Princess.' Aside from that I know nothing about her." One of the deputies later ran up and shook an accusing finger in Milo's face. "Don't you know you are suspected of murdering William Taylor?" he shouted at Milo. The actor's face showed instant relief and he broke into a smile. Then he reached over and shook hands with his questioner. "That's a good joke," he said. "You really had me frightened for a while. I didn't know what you wanted me for. But if that's it, why it's too ridiculous to do anything about except laugh." The officers were not satisfied with this denial and bundled Milo into an automobile. He was taken to the South Alvarado street bungalow court, where he was dressed as the mysterious stranger was supposed to have been and made to promenade in front of the place. Meanwhile Reineque was being subjected to an equally severe fire of questions. "Where were you Wednesday night?" iterated all of his questioners in chorus. "For heaven's sake! Give a man time to think," replied Reineque, scratching his head. He came from Alsace-Lorraine and speaks with a slight accent. Finally, after Mrs. Douglas MacLean had failed to recognize Milo as the muffled stranger whom she saw leaving Taylor's house and after continued questioning had failed to elicit anything of importance from either of the movie actors, they were driven home by the deputy sheriffs and dismissed with apologies for the inconvenience caused them. Both men were warned, however, that they were under surveillance and told not to leave town. Police Captain Adams and Detectives Cline, Cahill and Cato were with the deputy sheriffs and assisted at the investigation last night. Milo, a handsome chap of the movie leading man type, was still somewhat staggered by his experience of last night, when he was seen today. He was able to summon a smile, however, at what he characterized as the "ridiculous charge that I killed Taylor." His screen history in Los Angeles connects him as an actor with several prominent women stars with whom he has worked in various pictures. These include Pauline Frederick, Theda Bara, Clara Kimball Young, Ruth Roland and Mabel Normand. Milo today reiterated the statement he made to the officers that he only knew Miss Normand through working with her in one picture. The actor is of French birth, but has spent most of his life in America. Besides being an actor, he is an athlete of prowess. He formerly toured in vaudeville with an acrobatic act, in which he was "understander" and also posed in a leopard skin to show his unusual muscular development. ...The disappearance of a frilly diaphanous article of feminine apparel, which Peavey said had reposed for months in a box in one of Taylor's dresser drawers, was another grain of mystery in the case today. The valet happened to remember about the missing garment and informed the police. It was in its usual place up to the night of the murder. Peavey said he did not know who the owner of the garment was or why Taylor kept it.

February 6, 1922 LOS ANGELES RECORD Mary Miles Minter Lays Rose on Dead Friend

...It was early Friday afternoon that Miss Minter came to view Desmond's body. She carried a dozen Black Prince roses intertwined with fern. As she saw the beloved form upon a couch she burst into tears and asked the friend who was with her to leave the room. The door closed behind him and for a few brief moments she was alone with Taylor. When Ivy H. Overholtzer, funeral director, opened the door a little later she was standing bowed over the body, her tears falling upon the gray silk robe in which it was clothed. Turning to the mantel upon which she had placed the roses she drew forth a single bud and laid it across Taylor's chest. Then, sobbing her grief, she left the room and was driven away in her car...

February 6, 1922 Estelle Lawton Lindsey LOS ANGELES EXPRESS Denies Story of Love for Taylor

"On my word of honor, on my word of honor. Get it straight, please." Mabel Normand emphasized that phrase all the time that she talked to me about William Desmond Taylor, the moving picture director who had been her friend and who was mysteriously murdered shortly after he had placed her in her auto Wednesday night. Miss Normand, nervous and shaken, heavy-lidded from loss of sleep and the grueling inquisition to which she has been subjected since the murder, came into her delightful sitting-room this morning and talked freely of her friendship with the dead man, and the rumors that since his death have arisen about him. "I was never in love with Mr. Taylor in the way one means when they use the expression 'in love.' If he was in love with me, he never told me. "There was no thought or talk of marriage between us. Our friendship was based on comradeship and understanding. In many ways he was wonderful. I loved to go out with him because he understood so well when my work forced me to break engagements, and because we loved so many of the same things, books, music, pictures." "Do you know any woman who might have been jealous of you, who might have loved Mr. Taylor?" I asked. "On my word of honor, no," she cried, beating her tiny hands together. "Or any man who might have been jealous of the place that he occupied in your esteem?" Again the emphatic denial and the movement of the slender hands. "It has been hinted that he had dope parties," suggested another reporter. "Did you ever hear of them?" "Never, in God's world, never, on my word of honor. Billy was one of the cleanest and most temperate men in all his habits. He was sick, and very careful of his diet. He loved clean, simple pleasures, and he was a kind and thoughtful friend. "Flowers? Yes, he sent them to me three times a week. He knew that I loved flowers. And--yes, he telegraphed me often when I was in New York, but not every night. His telegrams were sometimes about things he wanted me to get for him in New York, sometimes just efforts to keep me posted about things here. I bought golf balls for him and he looked after the welfare of my dog and often wired me that it was well. "And, oh, please, say that I never heard of that pink nightgown, and that I always went to Mr. Taylor's dinners with a crowd." "Henry Peavey, the colored servant, said"-- "He ought to be ashamed to say that I asked him about other girls going to Mr. Taylor's house," Miss Normand burst out. "Henry ought to be grateful to me. I saved him his job when Mr. Taylor wanted to fire him. I begged that Billy wouldn't fire him on a rumor which might be false. "And say this, please, on my word of honor, I never spoke to Henry in my life except in Mr. Taylor's presence, and can you imagine my asking before Billy about other girls? Henry has told an awful big story. "I hope they find my letters because they are just little messages about everyday things. I never did go to the house to search for them. I only went to show the police how the furniture had been arranged. "I can't imagine anybody wanting to kill Billy. He was the kindest, most patient and tactful man I ever knew. I never knew him to lose his temper and, no, I never saw him show fear." And so the little star rattled on, begging, explaining, replying to all questions with the utmost frankness and detail. "She's worn out, poor little thing," said A. McArthur, publicity manager for the Sennett studios. "She wants to help clear up this mystery, but she needs rest terribly. We can't take her out of town. If we do everybody will say she ran away, and nobody will let her rest in town; the telephone goes every minute and the doorbell, too. "The poor kid lost a friend when Taylor died, but she knows nothing about why or how he died. You can bet on that."

February 6, 1922 LONG BEACH PRESS Los Angeles--"Comb the dope dens of Hollywood!" This terse order was issued today by Detective Captain David L. Adams, following a conference at police headquarters of all agencies working on the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery. Although Adams would make no statement to the press, it was understood that a new clue had been received connecting the supposed slayer of the famed motion picture director with the operations of a well-organized Hollywood "snowball" ring. Detective Sergeants Mailheau and Yarrow of the narcotics squad, immediately left Captain Adams' office to launch a rigid investigation of the alleged dope peddlers and their operations. Captain Adams denied a newspaper report that the police were looking for a prominent Los Angeles man, formerly engaged to a film star. It was reported that this man had checked out of his hotel here on the day after the murder and crossed the border, presumably at Tiajuana. "This report is erroneous," Adams said. "We've already traced the 'lead' and abandoned it."...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

February 6, 1922 LOS ANGELES HERALD ...There was some friction in the police probe of the slaying today and it was reported that certain detectives had asked to be given other assignments rather than continue investigating the murder with asserted misunderstanding existing. Several detectives were inclined to the theory that the person who slew Taylor may have been mentally unbalanced, and qualified their remarks regarding that phase of the probe by discussing confidential reports obtained today from the mystery witness who called at detective headquarters and who was said to have stated he saw Sands near the scene of the slaying late Wednesday night. A clew regarding what became of the letters and telegrams said to have been in Taylor's dresser drawer, written by Mabel Normand, film actress and friend of the slain director, was given to the police today while the slaying was being investigated from the hour Taylor's dead body was found. Investigation was made of a report that after Taylor's death Miss Normand's letters were taken away by a visitor to the house. Considerable time was devoted to reviewing the occurrences at Taylor's residence following the finding of the body by Henry Peavey, negro valet- cook. It was pointed out that when aid for Detective Sergeant Tom Zeigler reached the bungalow court, fully a half hour after the report was received that Taylor had presumably died of natural causes, the house was virtually filled with strangers to the detectives who may have disturbed important evidence. The detectives who clung to the belief that Taylor was shot and killed in a "love triangle" by a vengeance-seeking lover, or by a hired assassin, continued to direct their investigation today into the realms of stardom and several of the leading actors and actresses were questioned regarding the slain director's recent activities, his intimates, his asserted affairs of the heart and the source from which he obtained select liquors. Detectives Theodore Mailheau and Lloyd Yarrow, members of the police narcotic squad, investigated reports that Taylor was a close friend of several film luminaries said to be addicted to the use of narcotics. Taylor was not a drug addict, say the police, but may have had knowledge of drug peddlers supplying the alleged addicts...

February 6, 1922 LOS ANGELES HERALD Another interesting picture of the past life of the slain director was revealed today by Miss Neva Gerber, film actress, who was at one time engaged to marry Taylor. Miss Gerber declared that she had seen Taylor wrapped in spells of utter despondency on many occasions and that on several of these period he had expressed a wish to "end it all." She said that Taylor often complained of ill health, declaring that he could not eat anything, and that he was usually most despondent when he had just completed a picture upon which he had been working extremely hard.

February 6, 1922 LONG BEACH TELEGRAM Los Angeles--Added impetus in the search for Sands was given yesterday by Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of the screen actor, who occupies a bungalow adjoining the one in which Taylor was murdered, exclaimed upon being shown a picture of Sands: "He looks very much like the man I saw leaving Taylor's house the night of the murder."... Throughout the unceasing investigation of the baffling case detectives are advancing on the theory that some place in the solution of the mystery will be found the hand of a woman. That the murder was committed at the direction of some woman whose life has touched Taylor's is the opinion held by many investigators. Further support was given this theory late last night when Mrs. MacLean told officials that the person she saw leaving the Taylor home "might have been a woman dressed in man's clothes."

February 7,.1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Chauffeur Gives Fresh Lead in Taylor Case

A chauffeur employed by the Yellow Taxicab Company last night gave officers investigating the murder of William Desmond Taylor, slain film director, what was regarded as one of the hottest leads thus far uncovered in the attempts to solve the mystery of the fatal shooting last Wednesday night. This chauffeur, who was taken in tow at once by Detective Sergeants King, Cato and Cahill, is named Meister and is reported to have taken a party from the vicinity of the shooting soon after the slaying. He was accompanied on his trip to the detective bureau by Sidney Glover, an official of the taxicab company. Captain of Detective Adams declined to discuss the new phase of the case. Earlier in the day he talked with the two new witnesses. They were not to be found last night, and were declared to be with the two detective sergeants. Several new angles in the investigation were opened up yesterday by deputy sheriffs working under the personal direction of Sheriff Traeger, Undersheriff Biscailuz and Criminal Superintendent Al Manning. While Mr. Manning refused to disclose what lines the Sheriff's investigation is taken, he admitted his officers, Deputies Harvey Bell and Fox and Nolan, were following leads that have developed new aspects of the murder mystery. "I cannot state at this time what we are working on, but the information uncovered by this office is very significant and is vital to the solution of the crime," Mr. Manning said late last night. Centering their efforts on finding Edward F. Sands, suspect in the investigation of the murder, detectives on the case yesterday followed several clews while Captain of Detective Adams held secret conferences with at least four important witnesses... Twice during the day all the detectives working on the case were called together in conference with Capt. Adams. They all declared they are concentrating their efforts toward finding Sands, the former employee of Mr. Taylor and an asserted robber and forger for whose arrest Mr. Taylor swore out a warrant. Few definite concrete developments were noticeable as a result of the day's activities. Further facts concerning the past and mysterious life of the slain man were uncovered. Many supposed clews were checked by the officers and found valueless. Charles Eyton, manager for the Famous Players-Lasky studio, where Mr. Taylor, a director of international reputation, was under contract, held a long talk with Capt. Adams. Henry Peavey, negro houseman who discovered the body of his employer, also was a visitor at the police station. Late in the day it was declared by the officers that missing letters known to have been kept by Mr. Taylor shortly before his death have an important bearing, in their belief, on the case. Among these letters were several written by Mabel Normand, film star, to Mr. Taylor. Everyone questioned by Capt. Adams concerning the letters has denied having them or removing them from the Taylor apartment on South Alvarado street, where his body was found last Thursday morning. Mr. Eyton, who was one of the first outsiders called to the scene, again yesterday said he had not seen them. Miss Normand last Saturday called at the house for her letters. She has not seen those which she wrote. Public Administrator Bryson, who has charge of the estate, says he has not seen them. The District Attorney's Office makes similar avowal. The visit of Mr. Eyton to the Detective Bureau was for the purpose of aiding in the search for Sands. Several witnesses who know the fugitive say they saw him in Los Angeles about the time of the shooting. At least two persons believe they saw him on the night of the shooting. One woman saw Sands within a block of the Taylor home within less than two hours of the time set for the murder... The investigation has simmered down to a process of elimination, with the finding of Sands as the first obstacle. Hundreds of theories, tips and clews have been investigated, weighed and discarded or added to the chain of circumstances being assembled by the detectives. During the day, representatives of Mabel Normand, who was the last friend who saw Mr. Taylor alive last Wednesday, called at the police station to tell the detectives that Miss Normand was going to have her telephone number changed to avoid the continual stream of calls made for her recently. The pink silk nightgown--a delicate, lacy piece of woman's lingerie-- that was found in the bachelor apartments of the slain man yesterday held attention of many persons. The garment was one of several formerly at the house, according to the statement of a former employee, and was there during the six months Peavey worked there. Employees preceding Peavey declared that the silken things so strange to a man's wardrobe were used occasionally, or at least were taken from their accustomed places, unfolded and replaced. Reports were circulated during the day that the owner of the night dress had been identified as an actress friend of the dead man. No official confirmation of this could be obtained. The garment, known to have been at the home on the morning the body was found, was not available for public scrutiny. The comment made by Mr. Eyton regarding the missing letters was as follows: "I have taken no letters from Mr. Taylor's home the day the body was found, nor have I taken any, or had any letters given me by anyone since. There were a number of papers and documents there. I watched the representative of the Public Administrator's office sort the papers. It was more than a half-hour after the body was found that I arrived there. In the meantime scores of persons went through the house." Mr. Eyton joined Capt. Adams and Public Administrator Bryson in the opinion that if any of Mabel Normand's letters were taken away from the Taylor home, they were taken by the man who killed Taylor or by some friend of Miss Normand who wanted to return them to the comedy star. "I have no interest in any of these letters," Mr. Eyton continued. "If I had them I would turn them over to the police, because I am interested only in one thing, and that is the capture of the man who murdered 'Bill' Taylor, my friend. I hardly think, however, that there was anything in the missing letters that would be of any assistance in the search for the slayer."... Several women and three men, all of whom knew Sands by sight, say that they saw him on the streets of the city during the last month. None of them spoke to him and several of them under close questioning by the police admit that they may have been mistaken...

February 7, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Hands in Air When Shot

Bullet Marks Found in Clothing Give Detectives New Theory About Taylor Murder

When William Desmond Taylor, noted film director, was shot to death in his South Alvarado street apartment last Wednesday night, he was standing with his arms lifted over his head and a .38-caliber revolver pressed against his side, some six inches below his left armpit and toward the back. Such is the new theory of the police advanced yesterday for the first time. They base their belief on a careful examination made yesterday of the clothing worn by the noted motion picture man when he fell, mortally wounded, to the floor of his living-room, about 8 o'clock Wednesday night. In a conference of the detectives working on the case, including Police Detective King of the District Attorney's office as well as the officers detailed from the detective bureau, a minute inspection of the garments was made. The hole through which the bullet entered was powder-marked. The marking was of such a nature that they decided conclusively he was shot by a revolver held pressed against his coat. By comparing the entrance of the bullet in the coat, and in the vest, a remarkable new fact was disclosed. The holes do not correspond in location when the coat is adjusted normally about the wearer. But when the arm was raised the hole in the coat was brought up to the corresponding hole in the vest. This fact led to the definite conclusion of the investigators that when Mr. Taylor was shot down he knew he was being attacked, that he was compelled to hold his arms overhead by the assailant. The discovery of the new-found facts did not change the police theory that the slayer slipped into the house by the front door while Mr. Taylor was absent for a few minutes. At that time he was escorting Miss Mabel Normand, celebrated film actress, to her automobile, after she had made a short call for the purpose of getting a book. During the temporary absence of Mr. Taylor, the assassin stepped quickly into the house and crouched behind the door, the police believe. From this position he had the drop on the film director when the latter re-entered and closed the door. That he ordered Mr. Taylor to put up his hands is now the belief of the officers. And while the victim was standing in this position he was shot to death, probably after a conversation, if the slaying was done for revenge. Some of the officers believe the shot could have made the same entrance holes in the coat and vest if Mr. Taylor was bending over to seize a chair at his writing desk in order to defend himself against the intruder. To support this belief they point to the overturned chair found in the apartment--the only suspicion that an attempted struggle was staged. To verify the belief the revolver was pressed against the coat when fired, Detective King took some of the clothing and experimented with shots fired from various distances. This confirmed the theory, he said. The piece of lead which penetrated Mr. Taylor's lung and all but went completely through his body was positively identified as having been fired from a .38-caliber, short, soft-nosed cartridge. This type of shell is commonly used, although it will not fit an automatic weapon.

February 7, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Missing Link is Welded

Slain Director Took Dancing Lesson Between Five and Six o'Clock on Fateful Day

The mystery of the missing hour in the last day of William Desmond Taylor's life, before he was murdered, was accounted for last night, after a diligent search and investigation of all the slain director's movements and activities. Since the discovery of Taylor's body last Thursday morning, Detective Sergeants Herman Cline, Cahill and Cato have been endeavoring to account for every hour of his movements on the day of the murder. From the minute he arose from his bed in the morning to the time of Mabel Normand's departure from his apartment a few minutes before the fatal shot was fired, every hour of his movements during that day had been checked over--but there was one hour enveloped in mystery for which nobody could account, yet uncovered through scores of persons were questioned. That hour was between 5 and 6 p.m., two hours before he was killed. Henry Peavey, the colored valet, stated that Mr. Taylor had left the house at 5 p.m., after announcing he was going for a walk. He left instructions with Peavey to inform Miss Normand if she called that he would return at 6 p.m. He returned at that hour. Where had Taylor spent that hour? The Times learned last night where Taylor had spent every minute of the missing hour, and the identity of the young woman with whom he spent it. Taylor, after leaving his apartment at 5 p.m., walked south on Alvarado street, remaining on the east side of the street. He walked two blocks to Orange street, crossed Orange street and turned east. Half a block east of Alvarado street he entered a large building, conversed briefly with a young man seated at a desk, met a young woman who knew him and for the next hour danced with her. He was taking his regular dancing lesson at the Payne Dancing Academy. The young woman was Mrs. Waybright, his dancing instructor. "He was just brushing up on some of the old steps," Mrs. Waybright stated last night. "He had always taken private lessons. His previous lesson was taken on the preceding Monday night. On Wednesday night I noticed nothing unusual about his actions. He was as jolly, though quiet and reticent to talk, as on his preceding visits. He never discussed his personal affairs with me while we danced. We only talked of his progress in dancing. Had there been any worry on his mind on his last visit I would have noticed it. "He had completed one course, and before his departure purchased a new set of tickets. he said he wanted to take up a tango step the following evening, which would have been Thursday. He added that he possibly would be on location Thursday, and that if he did not appear that evening he would surely come back on Friday. He did not come to the academy in his car on Wednesday night."

February 7, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER In William D. Taylor's effects two love letters, written in a school- girl code, were found. One of them is reproduced above. It is a code familiar to thousands of youngsters. The letter reads as follows. "I love you--oh, I love you so. "I had to come down because mama remarked that I always seemed to feel rather happy after being out with you. So here I am. Camouflage. "Furthermore, I am feeling unusually fine (more camouflage). I will see you later. God love you as I do."

February 7, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Mary Minter's Note Tells Love of Taylor

The story of a wonderful love. A young girls' adoration beating its timorous wings under the shadow of impending calamity. When a carefully treasured letter fluttered from the pages of a book, Thursday, it revealed a love idyll charming in its conception, dramatic in its development, peculiarly sad in its unfullfilment. The love story of Mary Miles Minter and William Desmond Taylor. Out of the cloud of circumstances brought to light by the murder of the famous director shines the clear ray of this remarkable romance between the cultured, dignified man of 50 and the beautiful ingenue of 19. In the search of Mr. Taylor's effects, conducted the morning after he met his mysterious death, chance played a freakish role. The examination virtually had been concluded. One of the investigators, selecting a book from the case at random, idly fluttered the pages. Out dropped a letter. He picked it up and found it to be an ingenuous love letter written on heavily embossed stationery. "Dearest: I love you--I love you--I love you," it read. And below this reiterated sentence appeared a line of crosses followed by a single cross, heroic in size. At the end it said, "Yours always. Mary." And on the wings and body of the butterfly crest appeared the words, "Mary Miles Minter." Miss Minter did not deny the authorship of the letter. "I did love William Taylor," she said. "I loved him deeply and tenderly, with all the admiration and respect a young girl gives to a man with the poise and culture of Mr. Taylor."...

February 7, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Detective Sergeants Cato and Cahill last night were questioning one of the most widely known motion picture actresses in the entire profession, expecting to secure vital information upon what several of the investigators believe to be the overshadowing theory in the William D. Taylor case. This theory is that a man who was in love with the actress in question, having the motive of jealousy, may have acted in response to the promptings of a wounded heart. Six headquarters men spent more than two yours late yesterday afternoon receiving the details of a story believed to be of great possible significance from C. M. Meister, a driver for the Yellow Taxicab Company. Meister was brought to police headquarters by S. Cooper, assistant general manager of the company. The narrative was, in substance, as follows: "On last Wednesday night at 10:55 o'clock I picked up four passengers at 620 South Broadway--two men and two women. "Upon entering the cab one of the men pulled up the window between themselves and me, apparently, so that I might not overhear their conversation. "I drove them to a number in the Wilshire district. (The Examiner is in possession of this number, but is withholding it for the present at the request of the police.) "One of the men and the two women left the cab and went into the apartment house. I afterwards learned that their apartment was on the second floor. "The other man remained in the cab and asked me to drive him to the Ambassador Hotel. I did so. He was in the hotel about fifteen minutes. He came out, carrying a leather brief case. "Shortly after entering the cab he appeared to show the greatest anxiety concerning this brief case. He handed it to me and said, 'I want you to deliver that. For God's sake, don't lose it.' "His order to me was, 'Drive to 400 Alvarado street. At least, that was the number I caught. There was a 400 in it, but I am not sure whether it was the even number." Taylor, it will be recalled, lived at 404-B South Alvarado. "I said to him," continued Meister, "'Don't you mean 400 ------ street,' naming it. "'Sure,' he said; 'I made a mistake.' "He asked me several times if the brief case was safe. I said it was. But he was very uneasy. 'Give it to me,' he said, and he took it and put it beside him. "When we reached the Santa Monica carline--at Santa Monica boulevard and Western avenue, I think it was, he asked me to stop. "'I'm going to take the car here,' he said. 'You will please deliver this,' and he handed me the brief case. "'There'll be a woman looking out the upstairs window waiting for it,' he told me. "I drove directly to the number on ----- street. Immediately upon my arrival a woman rushed out and asked, 'Have you got it? Did he put it in a box?" "I said, 'I guess this is what you mean,' and I gave her the brief case. "Just then a man came running from the side of the house; he was the man I had let out there with the two women. "He got into the cab. 'Drive me around,' he said--'just keep going around the block! "I drove him around three or four blocks and then returned to the apartment house. There was a car--a roadster in front. "When he saw this he became very much excited. 'Don't let them see me,' he said. 'Drive around again.' "So I drove him around several blocks the second time. The car was still there when we returned, and in even greater excitement he said, 'Don't let them see me. Keep on driving until that car is gone.' "Upon coming back the third time he asked, 'Is the car still there?' "'Yes,' I said, 'but they are turning on the light. I guess they are getting ready to leave.' "Just then a street car passed us. 'Keep behind this car,' he said, 'so they won't see me.' "But the street car went farther on than I had counted on and when we came opposite the roadster, which was then leaving, we were in plain view. "Upon seeing this my passenger gave an exclamation of alarm, fell to the floor and pulled down the curtain on the side towards the roadster. "When we stopped at the apartment house he got out and said, 'I was a
----- fool to do this thing'" The police last night were preparing to go to this house and question the occupants. What strikes them with greatest force is that the man who figured in the dramatic attempt at concealment wore a muffler around his neck. It was the man in the muffler whom Mrs. Douglas MacLean saw leaving Taylor's house the night of the murder. If this man had anything to do with the crime, a new theory enters. This is that the murder may have been committed between the time Meister took the four persons to the Wilshire street address and the time the man wearing the muffler rushed out and asked to be driven around the block--in other words while the first man was away on his errand to the Ambassador Hotel. Taylor's house is four blocks west of the home mentioned by the taxi driver. It would be possible to go from Taylor's apartment to this one through alleys, thus eluding detection. If Meister's passenger had anything to do with the crime, then, the police say, he must have called on Taylor soon after Mabel Normand left, probably had a talk with the film director and went away. Then came the episode of the brief case, which is supposed to have contained letters once possessed by Taylor and now missing. There was sufficient time while the first man had gone to the Ambassador for a person to have walked from the Wilshire street address to Taylor's house, committed the crime and returned. The only apparent discrepancy is as to the time the shot was fired. The police yesterday were taking a new view of this subject. Testimony that a shot was heard about 8 o'clock was so uncertain, they said, that no great reliance could be placed in it. On the other hand, a person has been found who heard a shot somewhere near 11 o'clock. The man with the muffler, it was learned yesterday, left for San Francisco the day following the murder. The police were greatly impressed with Meister's story, particularly those parts describing the actors in this mysterious drama as exceedingly nervous. First, the man who went to the hotel was excited and nervous over the brief case. The woman who rushed out to receive it was excited to the point of agitation. The man with the muffler was in a state of frenzy almost about being seen by the person or persons in the roadster. The woman who took the brief case is described as about 30. Meister took her to be a motion picture actress. The man who went to the Ambassador was about 30, of the business man type. The tall man in the muffler was about 35 and Meister supposed he was a motion picture actor. None of the Sheriff's officers seriously entertains the opinion that Edward F. Sands, discharged secretary-valet of Taylor, was the assassin. This is in contradiction to the strongly expressed opinion yesterday of Captain of Detectives David L. Adams. "I am now completely convinced," said Captain Adams, "that Sands is the man we want. I believe it was he who committed the crime. "We have today established important facts which enable us to reconstruct the crime with what we believe is absolute accuracy. "Experiments made by our own and outside gun experts demonstrate beyond question that the shot which killed Taylor was fired from a distance of not more than an inch or two from his body. "We have made many tests with the coat which he wore when the shot struck him down. In the test which produces a hole similar to that already appearing in the coat the muzzle of the revolver was held an inch from the garment. "When Taylor was shot he had his left arm up. "We believe that the murderer ordered 'Hands up!' and shot him when he obeyed that command. "The way I re-frame the picture is this: Sands was lurking around waiting for an opportunity to enter the house, possibly for robbery, and it may have been for some deeper purpose which we have not fathomed. "The known facts concerning the attitude of this man towards Taylor convince me that we do not know the whole story; we are still far from explaining, for instance, why Sands sent Taylor the pawn ticket and the letter signed 'Alias Jimmy V.' We are also in the dark as to why Sands used Taylor's old name, 'Deane-Tanner,' when he pawned the stolen jewelry. "Either when or after Taylor accompanied Miss Normand to her car, leaving the front door open, this man slipped into the house. And when the director entered he was there, covering Taylor with his revolver. "It is possible that Sands went there to secure something--a letter or a document, perhaps--and that he actually did carry away something. "It is urged against the Sands theory that he would have robbed the dead body, would have stripped off the diamond ring, extracted the money from the pockets and taken the platinum watch. "I have no doubt he would have done so under ordinary circumstances, as his whole career proves him to be a thief, but this situation was extraordinary. Without having purposed to do so, it may be, he murdered his former master. "And then, panic-stricken, he hurried from the house, his terror overcoming for the moment his natural instinct to rob." Although Captain Adams urges his theory with great earnestness, a number of the men working under him do not accept his view of the crime. They cannot conceive that Sands, if he were the man, would have passed over jewelry and money worth nearly $2000 and to be had for the stooping down and taking. However, Captain Adams yesterday issued this instruction: "Find Edward F. Sands. Whether he is the murderer or not, he must be eliminated." The identity of the person who extracted the Mabel Normand letters from Taylor's effects remained as much of a mystery yesterday as on the first day of the investigation. It is believed that a man of high position and great influence in the motion picture world found and took these, and others, thinking their discovery would injure the fortunes of actresses in whom he has a business interest. Public Administrator Frank Bryson yesterday admitted that he did not know where they were nor who took them. "When our representative arrived at the Taylor home Thursday morning," said Mr. Bryson, "the room was filled with detectives, motion picture people and reporters, and the premises were swarming with them. "This office took over all property, effects and documents involved in the estate. Naturally all letters he left belonged to the estate and it was illegal to remove anything. However, I do not understand that anything of money value was taken." Several letters received yesterday by the police department and the Sheriff's office relating to the record of Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored valet, led Captain Adams to question the negro at greater length regarding his possible knowledge. Peavey is the man who found Taylor's body and gave the alarm. According to Captain Adams, Peavey said nothing new of importance. It is the natural assumption of the detectives and Sheriff's officers that Peavey must have known the persons who called on Taylor. He has stated, however, that only four or five persons called during his six month's service with the director. Among these were Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean and Mabel Normand. In trying to learn what persons were entertained, Sheriff's officers have made a widespread investigation. Yesterday, it is reported, they learned from a source what may or not be authentic--that is something being investigated--that a noted film actress who has been mentioned frequently in stories relating to the case, made several calls at Taylor's apartment at night. It is also asserted by this same person that the actress said she was engaged to marry Taylor; that, in fact, they were to be married within a few weeks. But about New Year's Taylor and the woman had a violent quarrel and the director returned home under stress to such great emotion that he broke down and cried. This actress is one of those who wrote many letters to the picture director, and it is her letters particularly about the disappearance of which the police are so curious. Following yesterday's discovery that the bullet was fired at short range, the theory of suicide was advanced. The absence of a weapon would appear to make this entirely untenable. Also, according to the findings of Dr. A. F. Wagner, county autopsy surgeon, it would have been practically impossible for Taylor to have shot himself in the manner employed. It is only by a wild flight of imagination that one could picture him as a suicide, the police say, because there would have to be discovered in this theory some person who entered the apartment after the tragedy and took the revolver away.

February 7, 1922 W. W. Kane LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Mabel Scouts Jealousy as Crime Motive

"There can be no girl who was jealous of Mr. Taylor's attentions to me. His attitude toward me was only that of a friend who fostered my interest in the better things of life--music, painting and books. "We never spoke of love, neither of us was interested in the other in that way. If there was a girl with whom he was infatuated it surely was someone else, not I." Mabel Normand, famous motion picture star, ill from the persistent questioning by those who are seeking to find some one who might have taken the life of William D. Taylor in a spirit of frenzied jealousy, vehemently denied yesterday any love element that existed between her and the slain director. "Shortly after the inquest Saturday detectives investigating the case came to me and thanked me for my cooperation in aiding in the solving of this terrible tragedy," she said. "They told me they are thoroughly convinced it was an unfortunate coincidence that I was seen with him a short time before his murder. "Everything that I know that might lead to detection of the murderer I have told them. And no one would welcome the apprehension of the culprit that committed that foul deed more than I. "There have been insinuations made that I went to Mr. Taylor's house after the inquest Saturday to seek some of my letters to him. That is grossly erroneous. I went to the bungalow at the request of the detectives and in their company and solely for the purpose of showing to them the exact location of the furniture as it was placed in the room before I left. It was to show how disordered the place had become after the intrusion of the murderer. "If Peavey, his colored servant, says that I had asked him about any girls that Mr. Taylor had ever been interested in, it is a venomous fabrication. Never in my life have I spoken to this man directly, and never have I talked to him in any way except in the presence of others, including Mr. Taylor. And as for the subject of girls--the question never entered my mind." Miss Normand, heavy-lidded from lack of sleep, and worn from the grueling inquisitions to which she has been subjected since the murder, reiterated that no one welcomed the apprehension of the culprit more than she. As for the insinuations that Mr. Taylor had been an attendant at so- called "dope" parties, she added another vehement denial. "He loved clean, simple pleasures, not this sordid type," she said. He was one of the most temperate men in his habits I have ever known. "He sent me flowers, occasionally, yes. But it was only because he knew I loved them and like to have them about my house. But there never was an expression of love sent with them. He knew our friendship didn't extend to that--it was purely platonic, and like that of an older man interested in a girl who sought mental improvement, and the things that better one in the cultural world."

February 7, 1922 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Pink Silk "Nightie" From Taylor Home Traced To Actress

Los Angeles, Feb. 6--A pale pink nightgown of filmy silk, trimmed with lace, positively identified as the property of a certain famous motion picture star--whose name has already been mentioned in connection with the murder at his home here last Wednesday night of William Desmond Taylor, photo- play director--is now in the possession of the police and may play a dominant part in a solution of the mystery of Taylor's death. Other developments of the day were an assertion by Taylor's valet that Mabel Normand had told him she was going to marry the picture director, and renewed search for a young New York man now supposed to be at the Mexican border. The nightgown, previously described to the police by servants of the slain director, disappeared from Taylor's apartment on the day after the murder, but was found today after a diligent search by the authorities investigating the tragedy... In this case, it is said, the star to whom the nightgown is believed to belong is not a comedienne. The police do say the article has been identified positively as the property of a "celebrated motion picture star," however. A laundry mark of three letters gave police their clues to the ownership of the dainty garment. It had been kept in a box in a drawer of Taylor's dresser, Henry Peavey, negro valet of the murdered director, admitted. Peavey told the police, under pressure, that the gown had mysteriously disappeared the day after the murder. It was not until late today that it turned up, in the hands of a police detective who had been working independently on the case. This detective obtained what he declared to be positive identification of the nightgown. The injection of the woman film star into the mystery gives rise to more speculation about the identity of the assassin, as it enlarges the field of suspects to include all of the many men admirers of the girl, for at the present time the police view every intimate friend of the women who were known to be close associates of Taylor as a potential enemy and possible murderer through the jealousy which Taylor's attachment may have aroused...

February 7, 1922 NEW YORK TRIBUNE Los Angeles, Feb. 6--...Miss Normand was wrapped in one of those vampish kimonos that was seen in a recent film production this afternoon when The Tribune correspondent attempted to obtain from her some inkling of the contents of her letters. Her eyes, minus the magic of the make-up box, showed signs of worry, and her hair had not benefited by the treatment of the experts who beautify film stars before they make their appearance before the camera. "Positively Mr. Taylor and I were not engaged to be married, and neither of us thought of such a thing," she said in a voice that carried conviction. "But, in the event that others might have mistaken your intimate friendship for Mr. Taylor for something more serious, do you know who might have been expected to be jealous?" was asked. "No, on my honor, I know of no woman who might have been jealous of our friendship," said Miss Normand. "Neither is there any man who would have had the slightest reason for resenting our friendship. "Right here I want to add that I did not return to Mr. Taylor's house to find these letters and telegrams. They were of too innocent a nature to warrant such action. I am mighty sorry they are lost, however, as they would have proved everything I have said concerning them. "I had known Mr. Taylor for a long time. We were interested in the same things, went to dinners together and made many mutual friends. But that does not necessarily mean anything, even among the much discussed picture people about whom one hears so much these days." "But Henry Peavey (Taylor's valet) says that you"-- "Well, Peavey may have said that I talked of marrying Mr. Taylor, or not, but it positively isn't true. I said nothing of the sort. We were just friends, that is all." "Would you care to explain why friends would make use of the terms of endearment that are declared to have had their place in your letters and telegrams?" "Such terms--if you care to call them endearing ones--were used in their lighter sense only," she said. "They did not apply to either of us. You can readily understand that nobody would seriously call a big, strong man like Taylor, a soldier and man of the world, baby, except in jest, and"--this with a demure shrug of her shoulder--"you wouldn't think he would seriously call me 'Blessed Baby,' would you?"...

February 7, 1922 SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER Los Angeles, Feb. 6--...Mabel Normand, cinema star, talked freely with a representative of Universal Service late today in her luxurious apartments in a fashionable Los Angeles neighborhood. Miss Normand was one of the last persons to see Taylor alive. She said: "Mr. Taylor never attended a 'dope' party in his life. And I feel sure from my knowledge of the man that he certainly would never have tolerated the use of narcotics at a party in his home. "As for the mysterious pink nightie which the valet says was found in his house, I have not the slightest idea to whom it could have belonged. "While Mr. Taylor and I were pals and while I was a dear friend of his, I believe it really is a little unfair to me that my name should be so prominently connected with his. Mr. Taylor had many women friends besides myself. "I can say with perfect candor that I know of no woman who could possibly have been jealous of my friendship with Mr. Taylor, no do I know of any man who could have been jealous of me. "Please tell your millions of readers that I did not return to Mr. Taylor's home after the tragedy to get back my letters. I returned there with three detectives, at their request, to describe the appearance of the room when I left there early in the evening prior to Mr. Taylor's murder. "There is nothing of any interest in the letters. I only wish that they could be found and published, too, so that people could see how uninteresting they were. "As for Mr. Taylor having a violent temper, which might have won him enemies--well, that is absurd to anyone who knew him. Mr. Taylor was the most tactful and diplomatic man in the world. "And I am sure that he was never afraid of anyone. "Mr. Taylor's home for some time had been a center for the motion picture people. "They used to step in and see him at all hours. We went with the same people and were excellent friends. But we never discussed getting married. "In fact, I was rarely alone with Mr. Taylor. We were usually together in a crowd. "It is certainly most unfortunate that I should have stopped by his home for a book the night he was murdered, but there is no more reason for trying to connect my name with Mr. Taylor's than there would be with any number of other picture stars. "Mr. Taylor used to send me flowers three times a week and when I was back in New York he used to frequently send me telegrams. But that was all there was to it--just a lovely friendship. "As for the valet saying that I inquired if Mr. Taylor took other girls, that is too ridiculous to require a reply. "I was fond of Mr. Taylor because he was so sympathetic and when I was hard at work on a picture he understood how it was and never insisted that I go out to dinners and theatres and neglect my work. "I only wish that I did know something that would help the police to find his murderer. I am eager to help."

February 7, 1922 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE Pretty Actress Sought in Case

New York, Feb. 6--Lila Wylie, the beautiful actress who entered the limelight in New York last spring in connection with the "international blackmail ring" expose following the shooting of John Reid, wealthy manufacturer, is sought for questioning in the Taylor murder case in Los Angeles, it was learned today. Miss Wylie's possible connection with the mystery is said to be linked with that of "Dapper Don" Collins, also sought by the Los Angeles police. The authorities expect her to shed considerable light on her own activities as they concerned William Desmond Taylor during the weeks just preceding the murder. Miss Wylie disappeared from Los Angeles on the day the Taylor murder was discovered. She is not suspected of the crime, but the police expect her knowledge of Taylor to aid them. The police say they have traced her movements to Miami, Fla., where she is supposed to be registered at a fashionable resort hotel...

February 7, 1922 ST. LOUIS GLOBE DEMOCRAT Actress Given Third Degree After Silk Nightdress is Found

Los Angeles, Feb. 6--A motion picture actress was subjected to what the police termed a "long and grueling" questioning at her home here tonight, in an attempt to obtain a clew to the murder of William Desmond Taylor, director. The actress was said to be widely known, but her name was withheld by the police. Two detective sergeants questioned her. What they learned, they kept to themselves, but they admitted they were seeking to develop the previously advanced theory that Taylor had been slain by a jealous rival for the affections of the actress.

February 7, 1922 SHEREVEPORT TIMES Los Angeles, Feb. 6--...A remarkable feature of Mrs. MacLean's statement is her uncertainty as to whether the murderer, assuming she saw the man who committed the crime, was a man or a woman. She admitted that the one she saw might have been a tall woman. Now it is a known fact that Taylor himself was not addicted to any drug, but is reported that he attended two or three "hop" parties in order to get "atmosphere" and local color for pictures. A number of Taylor's close friends, however, and these numbered several women, were addicts. "We are going to dig deep in this phase," said one of the detectives, "because the whole scene of the crime may be laid in a setting in which the sale of drugs was the main spring." Henry Peavey, the film director's valet, said, however, that he had never seen any form of narcotics in the Taylor home...

February 7, 1922 DES MOINES REGISTER Los Angeles, Feb. 6--A dainty pink silk nightgown, bearing three initials of a motion picture star of the first magnitude, is held at police headquarters tonight as the latest clew in the William Desmond Taylor murder case. The delicate garment disappeared from its customary receptacle, a locked box in a bureau drawer at Taylor's home, on the night of the tragedy, his valet, Henry Peavey, admitted to police. "I didn't know where it was," Henry explained, "so I didn't say anything about it." Tonight it transpired that the gown had been in possession of a police detective who has been quietly working lines of his own. The detective informed his superior, Capt. David Adams, that he had verified the ownership as indicated by the initials. A small laundry mark also checked, he said. The little star to whom the garment is said to belong is not a comedienne who has been mentioned prominently in connection with the Taylor murder. She has gained much publicity during the last year because of numerous wealthy and prominent young men who have been seen in her company and to whom she was variously reported as engaged. Finding the nightgown in Taylor's possession, according to the police, widens the scope of possible suspects in the murder case to take in the wide circle of admirers of its owner--who is known to the police. The names of young men of national prominence and great wealth are on the list. Some are now in Los Angeles and others in New York. Hollywood was shocked by the disclosure. The name of the star involved was on every tongue. Taylor's closest friends professed amazement. They were utterly confused, they said, by the discovery and by the facts now coming to light which indicate the complexity of the dead man's past.

February 7, 1922 Edward Doherty NEW YORK NEWS Los Angeles, Feb. 6--Those letters written by Miss Mabel Normand to William Desmond Taylor, murdered movie director, letters signed "Your Baby" and "Blessed Baby," letters which disappeared after the slaying, have cluttered up the investigation of the crime and given the police another puzzle. One contingent of the detectives working on the mystery questioned a big director today in his studio. They had learned, they say, that two weeks ago this man endeavored to make Taylor give him the letters that are missing. They questioned this director for a long time. He denied that he knew anything about the letters. He denied that he had ever asked Taylor for them. He said he had no reason for wishing to recover them, and would not have asked for them even if he knew they were in existence...

February 7, 1922 CHICAGO HERALD-EXAMINER Los Angeles, Feb. 6--The investigation into the murder of William Desmond Taylor switched this afternoon to another prominent movie director. Detectives were hurried to a Hollywood motion picture studio to question him. It was said that two weeks ago he endeavored to obtain from Mr. Taylor letters and telegrams written to him by Mabel Normand. The director was reported to have visited the Taylor home within an hour after the body of the slain director was found...

February 7, 1922 Edward Doherty CHICAGO TRIBUNE Los Angeles, Feb. 6--...Capt. Adams' conference in his office late today with Charles Eyton, referred to the scenes at the bungalow. And eventually they got back to Mabel's letters. "I had heard about those letters," the captain said. "I looked for them when I went to the house Thursday noon, some time after Taylor's body had been found. They were gone." "It is possible some of Taylor's friends who got there first took the letters," Eyton said. "I would have taken them if I had been there in time." There were perhaps a dozen film stars at the house before the police arrived. One of the first to get there was Arthur Hoyt, a friend of long standing.

Photoplay Editions of Taylor's Films

During the silent film era, hundreds of books were published as "photoplay editions"--novels with a few pictures from the film inside. Either the film was an adaptation of the novel, in which case the book was a special movie edition of the novel, or else the book was a novelized adaptation of the film story. Four films directed by William Desmond Taylor became photoplay editions. Unfortunately, there were evidently no photoplay editions of his most literary film adaptations--neither "Tom Sawyer," "Huckleberry Finn," nor "Anne of Green Gables" were published as photoplay editions of Taylor's films, although there were later photoplay editions of remakes during the sound era. The four photoplay editions of films directed by William Desmond Taylor are:

"The High Hand" by Jacques Futrelle (Grosset and Dunlap), with eight pictures from the 1915 film featuring Carlyle Blackwell and Neva Gerber. If you are seeking this book, be sure to obtain the movie edition, as the original 1911 edition without film stills is far more common.

"The Diamond From the Sky" by Roy McCardell (Dillingham), with 16 pictures from the 1915 serial featuring Irving Cummings, William Russell, and Lottie Pickford. The first 1/3 of the serial was directed by Jacques Jaccard; the final 2/3 was directed by William Desmond Taylor.

"How Could You, Jean?" by Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd (Grosset and Dunlap). With eight pictures from the 1918 film featuring Mary Pickford.

"Jenny Be Good" by Wilbur Finley Fauley (Grosset and Dunlap). With four pictures from the 1920 film featuring Mary Miles Minter.
