8.Q. Can you remember, at the present time, the prices as established by you, of the various articles contained in the store? A. No, I cannot remember.
9.Q. Have you in your possession any memoranda, or any record, of these prices which were in effect during the time the accused was in charge of the ship's store? A. I have the original ship's store ledger, which is in the hand-writing of the accused, which contains the official price list. The judge-advocate stated that if there was no objection by the accused, he would like to submit the original record of these prices to the witness so that he might testify as to the prices for the various articles sold in the ship's store. Question by counsel for the accused: "Do I understand that the witness kept this himself?" Answer by the witness: "Yes sir. The entries on the ledger were made by the accused." Question by the judge-advocate: "Do you object to the witness being supplied with this memoranda in order to refresh his memory?" Counsel for the accused: "No, I do not." The judge-advocate submitted the ledger to the court, stating that the ledger was the memoranda from which the prices for articles, cost and selling prices, were taken. The court had no objection to submitting the ledger as requested. Examined by the judge-advocate.

26.Q. The accused is charged with having committed certain offenses, between January, 1915 and September, 1915; state what you know of the circumstances? A. Well, after the inventory on September 8th--it was about September 10th or 12th, I went to the ship's store one night to get a box of cigars, and one of the members of the crew wanted to know if he could buy...some almond bar. I told him that I did not have a price list. Counsel for the accused: "This conversation I object to. A conversation of this nature is not admissible in any court; it is not admissible in any jurisdiction in the United States, and I do not see why it should be admissible here. Any conversation with a member of the crew, in the absence of the accused is not admissible by any rules of evidence. I therefore object. This member of the crew, I might add, might say in the absence of the accused that the accused committed murder, and it would be just as much his right to testify to that as it would be to testify to what he is now trying to testify to. This conversation with a member of the crew is not admissible either for or against the accused. And, as I have already stated, I have no objection to the Paymaster saying that he, in consequence of any conversation that he may have had, he did that, that, or the other, but the conversation, and I believe you gentlemen will bear me out in it, is not admissible on any ground." The judge-advocate withdrew the question.
27.Q. On or about September 10th, did you have occasion to go to the ship's store for any purpose whatever, and if so, as a consequence of a conversation with a member of the crew, did you or did you not find that any irregularities had been going on in the story; if so, state briefly what they were? Counsel for the accused objected to this question. The court over-ruled the objection. Counsel for the accused took exceptions, and stated that any rights that he might have by the over-ruling of this objection would be saved. Witness continues testimony: "I ascertained that the accused had been selling almond bars at the rate of five cents each, or three for a dime; I then reported the matter to the commanding officer, and he ordered a board to investigate the irregularities in the ship's store.
28.Q. Do you know if the members of the crew on the U.S.S. PADUCAH had any means of knowing the correct selling prices of articles in the ship's store; if so what were they? A. To the best of my knowledge the price list was kept posted on the door of the ship's store. Only on one occasion did I notice the price was not posted, and the accused explained that it had blown down. He was instructed to replace it. I saw the price list there on several occasions afterwards. Cross-examined by counsel for the accused.
29.Q. Does the accused come directly under your supervision for any great length of time, that is, as officer or otherwise; have you had any occasion to meet him, or come in contact with him? A. From about January 1, 1915, to the present time.
30.Q. And other than finding out the discoveries which you have testified to, so far as you could observe, his character has been good? A. Excellent.
31.Q. And the information you received so far as irregularities were concerned was from conversation that you had with either a member, or members, of the crew, in the absence of the accused, was it not, Paymaster? A. No sir, I received my information through a Board of Investigation. I was present during the investigation.
32.Q. And that information was what they told you? A. What they told the Board.
33.Q. What they told the Board? A. Yes sir.
34.Q. That is the only way you got your information? A. Yes sir. ... Neither the court, the judge-advocate, nor counsel for the accused had any further questions to ask this witness.

70.Q. When was the last time you saw it? A. Why, I seen it this morning.
71.Q. Who showed it to you? A. Nobody showed it to me.
72.Q. Where did you see it? A. On the canteen, sir.
73.Q. How did you happen to see it? A. I walked by there; I was going to the scuttle butt to get a drink; when we go to get a drink we pass the bulletin board on the canteen, there, and as I passed it I glanced at it. I generally glanced at it when I passed.
74.Q. Do you generally glance at the price list? A. Couldn't hardly help it, sir. Yes sir.
75.Q. You didn't help yourself by glancing at it before Snyder was accused, did you? A. There was no price list there to glance at, sir.
76.Q. How did you happen to glance at it this morning? A. I just happened to glance at the bulletin board and took a glance at it.
77.Q. Well, was it for the purpose of verifying your memory of yesterday that you glanced at the bulletin board this morning? A. No sir.
78.Q. How did you happen to glance at it? The judge-advocate objected to this question on the ground that the witness has already testified, or explained, how he happened to see it, by a casual glance in passing the canteen, and it would seem that the manner of bringing out testimony by counsel for the accused savors of a desire to confuse the witness or to brow-beat him. The objection was over-ruled by the court and the witness instructed to answer the question. A. Well, as I said before, you could not help seeing it on the bulletin board as you passed by. As you go to get a drink you pass the canteen, and it is the custom to look on the bulletin board to see if there is any new orders posted. Most any person will glance at it, at the price list because it is right next to the bulletin board.
79.Q. That is how you happened to glance at it this morning, isn't it, Mr. Fields? A. Yes sir, exactly.
80.Q. Now when you bought this fountain pen for which you paid $3.75, why didn't you follow out your custom and glance at the price list first? A. There was no price list there.
81.Q. When you bought the other fountain pen was there a price list there? A. No sir.
82.Q. When you purchased this fountain pen from Mr. Snyder, did you ask him why there wasn't a price list posted? A. No sir.
83.Q. What did you purchase this morning? A. From the canteen, sir?
84.Q. Yes. A. Nothing.
85.Q. How did you happen to go in there? A. I didn't say I went into the canteen, sir.

99.Q. It should be posted on the canteen? A. Yes sir, it is posted.

35.Q. You previously testified to the selling prices of certain articles in the ship's store; will you explain how and by what authority these selling prices were established? A.

Recross-examined by counsel for the accused.
55.Q. Mr. Paymaster, you always found the accused a pretty efficient sort of fellow, or chap, or employee, at the time immediately prior to the time he was accused, while he was under you, did you not? A.

12.Q. Could you state approximately the month, or months? A. No further than during the spring, I could not even state the month.

The court reassembled at the expiration of the recess. Present: All the members, the judge-advocate, the stenographer, the accused and his counsel. The judge-advocate was called to the stand as a witness to produce the current enlistment record of the accused, and after being duly sworn, was examined as follows: Examined by the judge-advocate. [sic]
1.Q. What is your name, rank and present situation? A. Arthur J. White, Second Lieutenant, U.S. Marine Corps, attached to and serving at the Marine Barracks, Navy Yard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
2.Q. Are you the judge-advocate of the General Court Martial now in session? A. I am.
3.Q. As whom do you recognize the accused? A. As E.F. Snyder, yeoman first class, formerly attached to the U.S.S. PADUCAH.
4.Q. Are you the legal custodian of the current enlistment record of the accused? If so, produce it. A. I am. The witness produced the current enlistment record of the accused, it was submitted to the accused and the court and, there being no objection, was offered in evidence and so received.
5.Q. Have you read the record over? A. I have.
6.Q. From that record what is his standing? A. In what regard?
7.Q. As a matter of conduct and efficiency? A. From the enlistment record of the accused I find that during the period he has served in the United States Navy from September 19, 1911, to November 5, 1915, his markings are as follows: Sobriety and obedience are all 5, with the exception of one mark of 4.5 while serving on board the U.S.S. FRANKLIN from December 28, 1911, to December 30, 1912. On December 31, 1912, he was assigned duty in the pay department of the U.S.S. MONTANA and continued on this duty until detached November 5,
1913. He served as canteen yeoman on board the U.S.S. CHESTER from Dec. 31, 1913, to June 30, 1914. On September 30, 1914, he was in the pay office of the CHESTER. On September 9, 1915, on the U.S.S. PADUCAH he has a mark of 0 which is since the Court of Inquiry which examined into his accounts. His markings in proficiency are, 4; 3.5; 4.; 4.5; 4.5; 4.; 4.;
4.;4.5; 4.5; 4.8; 4.; and 0 which corresponds to the other marking since charges were preferred against the accused.
8.Q. He would be given the mark of 0 under any circumstances while under these charges? A. Yes. While serving on board the CHESTER at Vera Cruz on April 22, 1914, the accused volunteered to search small boats lying inshore, for snipers. There is an entry in his record dated 9-8-15, "Gross irregularities in handling canteen stores and giving unauthorized credit to enlisted men. Punishment not awarded on account of man being on sick list and transferred to hospital."
9.Q. And that last item you read states practically what these charges are that we are at present trying? A. So I understand it.
10.Q. Is the highest mark in efficiency 5? A. It is.
11.Q. And during the entire time of his enlistment, otherwise than the 0 recorded against him on account of these pending charges, there is no mark less for efficiency or otherwise than 3.5? A. None less than 3.5 and that only in one case, which mark is under the heading "Proficiency in Rating."
12.Q. Would you consider the marking and the rating as contained in that book an excellent one? A. I would.
13.Q. Would you consider it beyond the average? A. I would consider it beyond the average?
14.Q. Would you consider it considerably beyond the average? A. I would.
15.Q. Would you consider that a man who volunteered to go into small boats during the trouble down in Mexico was a most desirable seaman in the United States Navy? A. That would depend largely on circumstances. However, I should say that he was a desirable man.
16.Q. From reading Mr. Snyder's record, would you consider Mr. Snyder, being that volunteer, a most desirable member of the United States Navy? A. I would. The judge-advocate did not desire to cross-examine this witness. Examined by the court.
17.Q. Will you state the age of the accused as given? A. Date of birth April 4, 1893. Neither the accused (counsel), the judge advocate, nor the court desired to further question this witness. The witness verified his testimony and resumed his seat as judge- advocate. The defense rested. The accused did not desire to make a statement to the court. The counsel for accused submitted an oral argument to the court, in substance as follows: "Mr. President and gentlemen of the court, I am somewhat, of course, as you gentlemen will readily understand, at a disadvantage in coming before a court of this sort; in one way I might add that I consider it a disadvantage and in another way a considerable advantage, somewhat of an advantage on account of the experience, and considerably I am at a disadvantage on account of the fact that the procedure is a little different from that to which I have been accustomed and concerning which I have been trained. I feel, however, that I am coming before a court that, to say the least, is mighty human. I really believe in my own mind that I do not exaggerate matters when I state that in my opinion I am before a court which cannot in any way be fooled by any technicalities, even if I had a desire in my mind to get the accused off by such methods. The fact is the evidence is fully in your minds upon which these charges are based. Anything that I might say perhaps would not influence you except insofar as you might be influenced by the fact that the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused here is guilty of the offense with which he is charged. Now, I am not going to in any way undertake to sum up the testimony of the various witnesses. You, gentlemen, know it, it is fresh in your minds and you are just as capable of forming an opinion as to whether that testimony should have any weight as I am, and perhaps much more so, but I would like to make this only as a suggestion, that there is not a particle of evidence offered against this accused that has the slightest weight in proving the charges of which he is accused. In the first place, my brother has not shown that he has over-charged for any article because my brother has not been able to show that the accused knew what the regular prices were. There has been no testimony introduced here, with the exception of the Assistant Paymaster's, that there has been any charge which was beyond the regular prices that the accused should have charged. The Assistant Paymaster, if I remember it correctly, stated that the price of soap, I think, was four cents. The testimony of some of the witnesses here is that they paid four cents for the soap. There has been testimony by some of the witnesses to show that they paid more for Pebeco tooth paste, I think, and Colgate's shaving soap than really ought to have been charged them, and I think that another witness testified that he tossed down a nickel for one of the articles and did not wait for his change. "Now, upon that testimony, it would seem to me that even if you believe it, and I am not questioning the veracity of the witnesses for the prosecution--even if you believe it, it should leave a reasonable doubt in your minds as to whether or not this boy is guilty of the offenses charged. I assume that if any doubt exists in your minds which you gentlemen consider is reasonable, this boy will be given the benefit of the doubt. I might state in passing that I never realized the seriousness of offenses against the United States Government until I got into this case. I do not believe the boy can possibly realize what a serious position he is in, whether innocent or guilty. You, gentlemen, know that which I did not know and possibly what this boy did not know either, and I have only this to add to what I have already stated in rather a hesitating manner, that it would seem in view of his record and in view of the testimony as it has been given that there must be a reasonable doubt as to this boy's guilt and I simply ask, if that doubt exists, that you will give him the benefit of it." The judge-advocate submitted the case to the court without remark. The court took a recess until 2:00 p.m., the same date. The court reassembled at the expiration of the recess. Present: All the members, the judge-advocate, the stenographer and the accused. The accused stated that he waived the right for his counsel to be present. The record of the proceedings of yesterday was read and approved. The trial was finished. The judge-advocate stated that he had no evidence of previous conviction. The court was cleared. The judge-advocate was recalled and directed to record the following findings:

The specification of the first charge "Proved in part--proved except the words 'Pebecco tooth paste," 'Cashmere soap,' 'Bicycle,' 'fountain-pen ink,' 'Epicure tobacco' which words are not proved; and the words 'one hundred' which words are not proved and for which the court substitutes the word 'seven' which word is proved." And that the accused Edward F. Snyder, Yeoman first class, U.S. Navy, is, of the first charge, "Guilty." The specification of the second charge "Proved in part--proved except the words 'Pebecco tooth paste," 'Cashmere soap,' 'Bicycle,' 'fountain-pen ink,' 'Epicure tobacco' which words are not proved; and the words 'one hundred' which words are not proved and for which the court substitutes the word 'seven' which word is proved." And that the accused Edward F. Snyder, Yeoman first class, U.S. Navy, is, of the second charge, "Guilty."

The court was cleared. The judge-advocate was recalled and recorded the sentence of the court as follows:

The court therefore sentences him, Edward F. Snyder, Yeoman, first class, U.S. Navy, to be reduced to the rating of Landsman, U.S. Navy; and then to be confined in such place as the convening authority may designate for a period of one (1) year; then to be dishonorably discharged from the United States Navy; to perform hard labor during said confinement and after his accrued pay shall have discharged his indebtedness to the United States at the date of approval of this sentence, to forfeit all pay that may become due him except the sum of three dollars ($3.00) per month during said confinement for necessary prison expenses, and a further sum of twenty five dollars ($25.00) to be paid him when discharged from the service pursuant to this sentence.

The court, having no more cases before it, adjourned to await the action of the revising authority.

Submitted, with the recommendation that the proceedings, findings, and sentence, of the general court-martial in the foregoing case of Edward F. Snyder, yeoman first class, U.S. Navy, be approved. The accused in this case was convicted of "Fraud in violation of Article Eight of the Articles for the Government of the Navy," the specification thereunder alleging that while attached to and serving on board the PADUCAH and performing the duties of ship's store yeoman of said vessel the accused by virtue of such assignment, custody, and sale of stores of the ship's store, knowingly and fraudulently and with intent to defraud other persons in the Navy, charged certain members of the crew of the PADUCAH amounts in excess of the prices lawfully authorized by the pay officer of the said ship for certain articles from the ship's store, and "Embezzlement, in violation of Article Fourteen of the Articles for the government of the Navy," the specification thereunder alleging that the accused having sold knowingly and fraudulently, and with intent to defraud certain other persons in the Navy certain articles carried in the ship's store of the PADUCAH at prices in excess of the lawfully authorized prices, did knowingly and fraudulently misappropriate and apply to his own use and benefit certain sums of money derived from the charges in excess of authorized prices for the same. The prosecution established conclusively that the accused had over- charged certain members of the crew for thirteen of the eighteen articles upon which the excess charges were alleged to have been made, the remaining articles having been properly excepted by the court in its findings under the specifications. The defense made no offer to refute the charges and offered in evidence the past good record of the accused. It is noted throughout the record that the court frequently allowed oral arguments upon the admissibility of evidence to be recorded in violation of Article R 828, U.S. Navy Regulations, 1913. However, the counsel for the accused urged that his objections and the reasons therefore be recorded in order that they might be brought to the attention of the reviewing authority. The court in view of such a request from counsel for the accused, should have invited his attention to the foregoing article and required that he furnish the court with briefs of such arguments in order that the same might be appended to the record. It is further recommended that the Naval Prison at the Navy Yard, Portsmouth, N.H., be designated as the place for the execution of so much of the sentence as relates to confinement. Respectfully referred to the Bureau of Navigation for comment.

Wallace Smith: February 22, 1922

The following is another of Wallace Smith's sensationalizing dispatches on the Taylor case.

February 22, 1922 Wallace Smith CHICAGO AMERICAN The last woman William Desmond Taylor held in his arms and kissed before he died -- the actress suspected of having murdered him in an outflaming of mad jealousy -- was secretly questioned today by detectives, who found her hidden and under the protection of hired guards in a Los Angeles suburb. Nervous and shaken at the hint that she would be arrested and charged with murder, she cried out her denial of the killing and her denial of any but a "sisterly" affection for the eccentric genius of the films. It was a scene as dramatic as any she ever acted before the camera -- but not quite as convincing. At least not to the detectives. Because they had in their hands a sheaf of letters which had been newly found, which showed this woman on the most intimate terms with Taylor. And they had, too, the love scenes between her and Taylor narrated by Henry Peavey, houseman of the slain movie director. Frustrated at last by an apparent "collapse" of their subject, with a busy physician on hand to report her condition serious, they swore that they would return to the grilling with fresh fuel. "If she didn't kill Taylor," declared one of the detectives, "she knows who did. And she'll talk yet. We made the mistake of not putting her under arrest the day of the murder. She's the one real clue we've had since they found Taylor's body; if she wasn't so prominent and so well protected by the influence she has over powerful men, she would have been behind the bars before now." It was to this actress, it was rumored, that Taylor made the present of the $12,000 Oriental jade as a "peace offering" after a quarrel. It is known that she made him gifts as costly. The jade is said to have disappeared. She admitted being in his house the day Taylor was killed, and even that he had put his arm around her. "But it was just the sort of thing that a brother might do," she said. "We were very dear friends -- that is all." "Did you go to his house late at night," she was asked, "and remain there until morning?" "That is a lie," exclaimed the woman. "Was there another man in the room beside Taylor," was the next question. "A man who was in love with you?" "That isn't true," she replied. "We were alone." "Did you have a gun that night?" It was at this point, according to the report, that the subject collapsed. More and more as the little tangled ends of the stories are straightened out the affair of Taylor and the woman suspected becomes clear. Detectives working on the case believe that she and the woman who is known to have visited Taylor in the early hours of the morning are the same. With her, it appears, "Bill" Taylor was not the austere but paternal friend. With her he was the impassioned lover, playing the sort of part he had directed often from the small end of the megaphone out "on the lot." To her he carried the finished product of many rehearsals -- of many such affairs. It is known that they quarreled. She is said to have admitted that, too. But the same report states she insisted that it was just a trivial dispute and soon settled. Officers under orders of Undersheriff Eugene Biscailuz have been instructed to keep the actress under surveillance. "She is the one logical suspect," declared Biscailuz today. "She has not told all the story. And we are not going to rest until she does. Half a dozen times she has been on the point of arrest. The next time may not fail." Undersheriff Biscailuz also announced that he would have his men examine the man who drives the actress' automobile. Through him, the undersheriff believes, he may be able to get some information about the woman's nocturnal visits and her relations with Taylor. [The actress referred to in the preceding material was clearly Mabel Normand.--ed.] The theory that the man helped a woman with the crime seemed to be strengthened with a new statement from Christine Jewett, employed in the household of Douglas MacLean, screen actor and neighbor of Taylor in Alvarado St. It was his wife who claimed to have seen a mysterious man leaving the Taylor home fifteen minutes after hearing what seemed to be the discharge of a revolver. "It was around 7 o'clock that night that I heard somebody in back of Taylor's house," said Miss Jewett. "I know the time because it was then that Mr. MacLean honked his automobile horn outside to tell me to start serving dinner. "I went to the screen porch. I saw the man then. When I came he stood still. A little later I heard him scuffling around. I was busy with dinner, but each time I returned to the porch I saw him standing there. He must have been there fifteen minutes, anyway. It was about a quarter of 8 that I heard the shot." Henry Peavey, the houseman, was taken to the district attorney's office and questioned again by District Attorney Woolwine, First Deputy District Attorney Doran and six detectives. This was after Peavey had revealed the love scenes between Taylor and the actress and had told stories to prove Taylor's infatuation for the woman. It also followed rather a harrowing experience for Peavey, who finds himself constantly being distracted from his favorite occupation of making crochet pillow tops. Volunteer investigators, believed by Prosecutor Woolwine to be employees of a Los Angeles newspaper, thought that Peavey might speak more freely if he was taken to the graveyard where Taylor's body lies in a vault and confronted with a ghost. According to a statement issued by Prosecutor Woolwine, "a pair of conscienceless blackmailers," representing themselves as officers of the law, invaded Peavey's room and took him prisoner. Thereafter, the prosecutor states, they held him prisoner until midnight before the cemetery experiment. Peavey was escorted through the midnight dark through the long array of tombstones to the Taylor vault. Here in solemn tones he was told to speak the truth. "I swear to the Lawd, boss," said Peavey, "I told you everything I know." At that moment there emerged from the gloom a wavering, tall figure, in a flowing robe. Phosphorent hands gesticulated menacingly in the dark and a pair of phosphorent eyes leered at the prisoner. "Whoo--oo--o--." moaned the figure. "I'm Taylor. Henry. Tell these men the truth." It was too much, even for Peavey. He enjoyed the first laugh he has enjoyed since he found Taylor's body. "You wouldn't fool me, big white body [sic], would you?" he chortled. And the shame-faced ghost wavered back into the night from which it had emerged. One thing a ghost can't stand, apparently, is laughter. The district attorney was quite indignant about the "third degree" methods attempted on Peavey. "It is regrettable," he said, in an official signed statement, "that the district attorney has no jurisdiction over the offense committed by these miscreants for the false imprisonment of this witness. I have not been able as yet to ascertain their names, but if I knew them and had such jurisdiction, they would be in jail today. "This presumptuous, dangerous and dastardly interference with the orderly course of procedure by the duly constituted authorities, is calculated to so terrorize good and well meaning people that they keep secret important facts that might lead to the discovery of the perpetrators of foul crimes." District Attorney Woolwine announced himself absolutely baffled at the mysterious ramifications of the murder and declared that he was going into the hills for a day in the saddle. Police working on the strange case were given copies of a letter received from one who signed himself, "J. Smith" and who mailed the epistle from San Francisco two weeks after the slaying. The writer declared that he had gone to Taylor to demand payment for "a consignment of stuff," that Taylor had attempted to put him off because of lack of funds, and that, as he drew a gun, Taylor grabbed the weapon and caused its discharge. The writer added that, as he made his escape he ran into a woman in Taylor's hallway. Also that has his letter was being mailed he was on his way to board a ship which was carrying him to foreign ports. The police chief declared that the letter might be a hoax, but he also declared that he would not chance overlooking a clue. Another suspect sought was a man known as "Morphine Mose," reputed to have been addicted to the drug which gave him his nickname. According to one report in the hands of the police, "Morphine Mose" was a dope peddler who did considerable "business" around the studios. The police were informed that Taylor himself had thrown this man out of the premises and that the man had sworn vengeance for the affront as well as for the interference with his business. The detectives also were interested in the whereabouts of one named "Anderson," said to be a friend of Peavey's who once secured employment through Taylor's houseman. Anderson, it was said, had spent several hours in the Taylor home at the invitation of Peavey. Later he lost the job Peavey is said to have secured for him. One theory was that the mysterious Anderson, familiar with the house and the fact that Taylor kept considerable jewelry and money about, had been trapped as he was robbing the place and had "shot his way out."
