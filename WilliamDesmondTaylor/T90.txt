Taylor the Actor: Vitagraph Film Plots

The following are plot summaries of most of William Desmond Taylor's films made for Vitagraph in 1913-14, as originally published in VITAGRAPH LIFE PORTRAYALS.

The Secret of the Bulb

[Taylor's role: "Jack, her Son"] Disapproving of her son's affection for Miss Martin, the nurse, Mrs. Richards loses no opportunity to tell her son, Jack, what she thinks of it. Miss Martin receives a letter from her brother, asking for money to get him out of a scrape. She puts the letter in a book she is reading. Not long afterwards, Mrs. Martin misses a ring which her little daughter Nellie has mischieviously taken and lost. The ring accidentally slips from her finger while she is digging her hand in the dirt, of a flower pot. Mrs. Richards, while looking for the ring, knocks the book which Miss Martin was reading off the table and finds the letter from the nurse's brother. She puts two and two together and comes to the conclusion that Miss Martin took the ring to raise funds for her brother. She calls the girl and dismisses her on the spot without even giving her a chance to defend herself. Miss Martin goes back to nursing at the big hospital. Later, when the bulb which was placed in the flower-pot in which little Nellie was digging, sends out its shoots, it carries the hidden ring to the surface, and when Mrs. Richards goes through the conservatory on a tour of inspection she discovers it. Nellie happens to run by at the time and from her guilty look it is easily seen that she is responsible for the ring being in the pot. Mrs. Richards is very sorry now for what she has done and she tells her son. He upbraids her for her injustice and tells her he will not speak to her again until Miss Martin has been found and exonerated. He goes to a detective agency to start a search for the girl and while there is wounded by the accidental discharge of a revolver. He is taken to the hospital. His mother comes to see him but he will not speak to her. His mother leaves him and while on her way out meets Miss Martin. She finally prevails upon her to go in to see Jack. A happy reunion follows in which the two lovers are reunited and a mother is forgiven

The Brute

[Taylor's role: "The Stranger, Man from Mary's Home Town"] Because he is a drunkard, Black Barton is despised by his friends and hated by his family. He hates them in turn because they do not understand that he fights against drink until nearly insane. Ted, his son, loves him but fears him and shrinks when he is near. The father loves his son and wants to be good to him but is filled with brutal rage when the boy shrinks from him. Barton goes to a saloon and drinks all day. A man whom Barton's wife had known in her girlhood days comes to see her. She is excited and pleased to see him. The children like him and he is much taken with them. A neighbor on the way to the saloon sees the wife and her friend, and when he reaches the saloon he tells Black Barton, who at once starts home with the intent to kill the stranger. He comes to the home and looks in the window. He sees his wife laughing happily with the man, and the children playing. He enters the house and the look of misery comes back to the wife's face and the children cower in fear. Barton realizes that without him his family has a chance of happiness. He turns abruptly and goes from the house. His son follows and tries to call him back but to no purpose. Arriving at the summit of a great precipice, he stands a moment with his face turned towards the heavens then plunges over the cliff and goes bounding down the rocky side to his death, hundreds of feet below. His body is found later by a party of prospectors. They realize as they look that "The Brute" had some redeeming trait in his nature after all.

The Love of Tokiwa

[Taylor's role: "Richard Davis"; Margaret Gibson's role: Tokiwa] When Yoshisada speaks to cruel Kajiwara, the wealthy Japanese fisherman, for the hand of his daughter Tokiwa, he is not graciously received. This does not bring tears to the wondrous, almond-shaped eyes of Tokiwa; she does not like Yoshisada. Neither is she fond of her father, who beats her and makes her work very hard. She has a friend in Anna Lang, who has a missionary school in the village, and in Richard Davis, who comes to the town to deal with Kajiwara concerning the village catch. Davis loves Anna; they are engaged to be married. They decide that they will take the little Jap [sic] girl away with them to the city. Tokiwa has fallen in love with Davis and mistakes his kindness for love. He tells her that he will take her away to a place where she will be very happy. His words are overheard by Yoshisada, who swears that it will never happen. Yoshisada tells Tokiwa's father of the American's words and together they plan a hurried wedding. The girl is literally sold to Yoshisada, that her services may not go to someone other than her father. Poor Tokiwa is in despair when she learns of the plans for her future. A telegram comes to Anna, saying that the American, who has been away, is coming back. Tokiwa borrows the telegram, having learned now how to read at the mission school. Her father sees the message. He tells Yoshisada, who vows that the American shall not reach the village alive. Tokiwa sends up a white dove which Davis had given her, with a prayer to save him. Yoshisada waylays Davis, and as he is passing in his car on a road hundreds of feet below the cliff, he rolls a huge boulder down upon him and believes he has killed him. Yoshisada loses his life at this place later, by falling over the cliff. Tokiwa dressed all in white and with wreaths of flowers about her, enters her boat and goes out alone in the sunset of the sea to find the heaven of the Americans. Later, when Anna and Davis and the villagers come to the beach to find her, they see an upturned boat drifting out on the silent waves.

How God Came to Sonny Boy

[Taylor's role: "Rober Vibrat, A Poor Artist"] Struggling to earn a living, Roger Vibrat, an artist, receives an order to paint an enlargement of a portrait, the money to be paid on delivery of the picture. He has no canvas the required size and no money to buy one. He tries in vain to get credit; no one will lend money to a poor artist. It is the day before Christmas. Sonny Boy, his little child, while showing pictures in a book to his mother, who is ill in bed, comes across a Sunday School card with the text: "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you." His mother explains to him the meaning of the text. When his father returns home, downcast, Sonny shows him the card and pointing to the words with his little finger, tells him that they are true. Roger braces up. He goes out and pawns his overcoat. He buys an old canvas on which to paint the picture. While cleaning the canvas, he discovers the signature of a famous artist on it. Wild with excitement, he cleans the canvas and shows it to a dealer, who gives him one thousand dollars for it. Roger buys food, toys and flowers for his little family; and when he returns home with his arms laden down with gifts, Sonny, wild with joy, runs up to him and says, "I knew God would come."

Tainted Money

[Taylor's role: "Jack Forsythe"] Greed prevents John Bennett, a wealthy financier, from giving any thought to the misery he causes among the poor people who are affected by his stock manipulations, with wheat, which raises the price of bread beyond the reach of the masses. His beautiful daughter, Constance, shares his delight in his financial success. By accident, she learns that her father's gain is the ruin of an old chum of hers, Jack Forsythe. She begins to see the harm that has been wrought. A settlement worker, David Spencer, realizes that Bennett is responsible for the pitiable condition of the people, having closed down his factory rather than accede to the workers' demand for more pay. David enters the Bennett home and forces Bennett to accompany him to the homes of the people who are suffering. Constance, his daughter, prevails upon him to be lenient with Jack Forsythe, getting there with the good tidings just in time to learn that Jack's mother has succumbed from the shock of her son's ruin. Bennett slowly begins to realize that his idea is wrong; that he really is to blame for the suffering of others. While walking to his works one morning, Bennett is set up by the mob and has to be rescued by David. He now pledges himself to help alleviate the suffering he has caused. Its latest form is an epidemic of typhoid. Unknown to the people, and using David as his lieutenant, he succeeds with the help of his daughter in relieving much of the suffering. When, six weeks later, the suffering is over, the people come and demand to meet their benefactor. When Bennett steps out on his veranda, they rail and shout at him angrily, until David explains that it is he who has helped them. Bennett then announces the engagement of David and his daughter, who have fall in in love during their work together in the slums, and states that he resigns his place to the young man, whom he considers the most worthy successor he could possibly choose. The crowd cheers him to the echo.

The Master of the Mine

[Taylor's role: "Arthur Berkow"] Having lost his wealth, James Arnold, an aged aristocrat, applies to Philip Berkow, a wealthy mine owner, of the middle class socially, for a loan. Berkow proposes that they make a matrimonial alliance between Arnold's daughter Eugenie and Berkow's son Arthur, one having the wealth and the other the social prestige. Anxious to maintain her own social standing, Eugenie reluctantly agrees, while Arthur, who loves the girl, also consents. The miners are on the point of an uprising in protest against certain conditions at the mine. They hold up the bridal party, but are dispersed by Hartmann, who is against violence. The wedding guests gather for the banquet, the elder Berkow lifts his glass to drink to the health of the bride, and falls dead of heart failure. A delegation of miners, headed by Hartmann, call upon Arthur and insist upon their demands. Arthur defies them. Meanwhile, Eugenie's father has received an unexpected legacy and persuades Eugenie to leave her husband. She goes to his office and sees the situation between the husband and the angry miners, which brings to her her first realization of real respect for Arthur's manliness. She tells him of her intention of leaving him. He listens to her calmly and tells her she can go. The miners plan to blow up the mine. They place the powder and are about to return when part of the tunnel caves in. Arthur rushes to the mine and goes down the shaft to rescue the men. He saves them all, but he is entrapped. Eugenie pleads for them to rescue her husband; all refuse. She starts down alone. Hartmann springs into the bucket with her. They find Arthur and bring him safely up, amid the cheers of the crowd. The explosion comes, as Eugenie and Arthur stand apart, and, looking into each other's eyes, realize that their love is mutual.

Millions for Defence

[Taylor's role: "Bob"] Young, pretty and flirtatious, "Billie" is spoiled by too much attention. She refuses Arthur when he proposes, and later boasts to her girl friends she can make any man propose. Arthur's chum, Bob Clinton, is a millionaire, and, according to a newspaper article, a confirmed bachelor. The girls see this, and "Billie" immediately determines to make Bob propose. She sends Bob her picture and a declaration of war, reading, "I have decided to marry you!" Angry and worried, he replies, "Millions for defence, but not one cent for trubute." He then orders the butler, who is smitten with her picture, not to admit "Billie," should she call. Billie goes to see Bob and talking sweetly to the butler, walks right by him into Bob's presence. He is greatly surprised and becomes rather frightened. Rushing outside, he calls up a detective agency and and manager sends a score or more plain clothes men for his protection. "Billie" says, "Shame, calling detectives!" and goes out promising to call again. On her next visit she is unable to get in the house. She intercepts a telegram to Bob from his mother, gets and idea, and again visits Bob, disguised as his mother. She gets in all right and Bob is horrified when he discovers the deception. He calls up Arthur, requesting him to come at once, to take Billie away and marry her. Arthur arrives, adopts a butler's disguise and on "Billie's" next call, stops her and tries to kiss her. She slaps his face and runs out, but comes back later. After a chase, Bob has just succeeded in locking her in a side room, when his mother drops in. After many exciting and anxious moments, Bob decides to have it over with, and going into the room, proposes to "Billie," who turns him down. As they come out, Billie's father, who has learned of the incident, enters. In order to explain the situation, "Billie" and Bob pretend to be engaged. Their parents are surprised, but offer congratulations and depart. Finding they really love each other, Bob, after a genuine proposal of marriage, tenderly clasps her in his arms.

The Kiss

[Taylor's role: "George, Society Man"; Margaret Gibson's role: "Alice, A Shop Girl"] Contented and happy, Alice, a little shop girl, smiles with satisfaction as she looks at her little clay bank containing her savings. Fred, the floorwalker in Berkley's story where Alice works, is sincerely in love with her. George Dale, a wealthy young society man, takes his fiance, Helen Bradley, out riding. Their car is stalled and in fixing it, his necktie becomes spattered with oil. He stops in at Berkley's to buy another. Mazie, a flashily-dressed girl at the counter next to Alice's, waits on him. George starts a flirtation with her. Alice overhears them and the poison of discontent and envy creeps into her mind. She decides that the attentions Mazie receives is owing to her pretty clothes. She determines to purchase some and that night breaks open her little clay bank. Fred expresses strong disapproval of Alice's new finery. When George comes in the story again, he is struck with her appearance, and ignoring Mazie, invites Alice out to dinner. Alice and George meet his fiance and Betty, her friend. George introduces Alice as his cousin. Helen impulsively kisses her on the cheek. Alice has an awakening and her conscience begins to trouble her. Later, when George tries to kiss her on the cheek in a restaurant, she springs up, saying, "No! No! That is where SHE kissed me because she loved YOU!" Hurrying home, she casts off her now repugnant finery and returns to her more modest attire. Repentent, George tells Helen the truth and his sincerity wins her forgiveness. Next day, the landlady's little child gives Alice a kiss on the same cheek that Helen had kissed, while Fred, happy that she has gone back to the simple things of life, steals up and adds his kiss to the others. Alice is happy and realizes that contentment is the foundation stone of happiness.

A Little Madonna

[Taylor's role: "Paul Langrois, An Artist"; Margaret Gibson's role: "Marie"] Terrorized by Guido, her drunken and brutal father, Marie receives assurance from her dying mother that the Madonna will always protect her. The father reels in just after the mother has expired, too drunk to realize the woman is dead, and finding the whiskey bottle empty, abuses the child. Marie appeals to the image of the Madonna and Guido, in a frenzy of rage, smashes it on the floor. Horrified at the sacrilege, Marie screams, bringing in the neighbors, among them Paul Langrois, a young artist and curio-lover. Paul's sympathy is aroused and he adopts the child. Later, Marie's father, who is ignorant of her whereabouts, sees Paul purchase an expensive silver image of the Madonna. He determines to steal the statue and follows Paul home, planning to return that night and get it. The little statue is put in a prominent place by the worshipful Marie. Paul conceives the idea of painting a picture of the Madonna. He sends for a professional model and she is just donning her costume when Paul is called away on urgent business. He tells her to wait as he will be back shortly. He is delayed until dark, however, and the model falls asleep in the dressing room. While Marie is performing her usual devotions before the Madonna, Guido pries open the window and stealthily enters. Marie hears him and as he is about to take the silver Madonna, she grabs his arm with a scream. The door is flung wide and the model, awaken by the scream, stands in her Madonna robes, in a blaze of light. Filled with superstitious terror, the awe-struck man rushes from the place. Marie at first thinks it is the Madonna herself and kneels reverently. The model lifts her up and explains who she is, sympathetically assuring the child she need not fear. Marie feels sure that her mother's words have come true and gratefully offers up a little prayer for her safe deliverance.

He falls in love with Bonita, niece of Don Arana, foreign minister to Rosas, the tyrant. Bonita favors the rebels and through Wainwright's love for her, wins him to their cause. He communicates with General Urguiza, the rebel leader, but the messenger is intercepted by Tirzo, Rosas' spy. Tirzo is an aspirant to the hand of Bonita and to get Wainwright out of the way, suggests it would be well for him to leave the country at once. Wainwright takes passage on the first ship leaving for the north, but secretly swims ashore immediately after the vessel leaves port. He returns to Don Arana's home and acquaints Bonita with his plan to join the rebels. Wainwright, as a rebel leader under the name "Captain Alvarez," so distinguishes himself that he becomes the scourge of the Federals. He is commissioned by General Urguiza to arrange with Don Arana, who is secretly in sympathy with the rebels, for the capture of a convoy of a million in currency dispatched to the Federal forces. While they are talking the house is surrounded by Federals through the work of Tirzo, and Alvarez is led off a prisoner. Tirzo promises Bonita to save Alvarez's life if she will marry him. She is about to consent when word comes that the prisoner has escaped by an appalling ride over a native foot bridge on Mephisto, a wonderful horse given him by Bonita. Alvarez returns to Bonita's home, tells her of the convoy and promises to return again at midnight to make sure of her safety. Alvarez and his command capture the million in currency and he leaves to keep his midnight appointment, when he hears Tirzo plotting with a band of gypsies to kidnap Bonita. Alvarez arrives at Don Arana's first. Tirzo enters alone and in a fight the spy is killed and his body carried off by the gypsies. A band of Federals stop them, recognize Tirzo and rush to Don Arana's house, where they capture Alvarez. He is ordered shot at sunrise. The Federals are defeated and Rosas, the tyrant, flees for his life. The rebel forces arrive in time to save Captain Alvarez and all ends victoriously.

Bushnell, a multi-millionaire banker at Springfield, O., is scheduled for tomorrow, according to advices received yesterday from Cincinnati. They have been removed to the Hamilton County jail from Troy, O., following indictiment by the United States grand jury. An extensive list of witnesses from many parts of the United States, including Los Angeles, were heard. Bushnell is a son of a former governor of Ohio, Asa Bushnell. He was a witness before the Federal grand jury.

October 31, 1923 CINCINNATI ENQUIRER Blackmailers Enter Pleas of Guilty

Don Osborn and Rose Putnam, alias Rose O. Cooly, Los Angeles, Cal, who were indicted by the recent Federal Grand Jury on charges growing out of alleged attempt to blackmail John L. Bushnell, Springfield (Ohio) banker, and son of the late Asa S. Bushnell, Springfield, former Governor of Ohio, came before United States District Judge Smith Hickenlooper yesterday and pleaded guilty to charges of having entered into conspiracies to violate Federal laws. Osborn was sentenced to serve 21 months in the Federal Penitentiary at Atlanta, Ga., and was fined $500 and costs. Miss Putnam was sentenced to serve six months in Miami County Jail, at Troy, Ohio, where she and Osborn have been confined since their arrest last July following an alleged second attempt to obtain money from Bushnell. Prior to their appearance before Judge Hickenlooper, it is said, both Osborn and Miss Putnam confessed to the Federal officials and, in Court, they told Judge Hickenlooper they were ready and willing to aid the Government by their testimony when others, alleged to have been associated with them, are apprehended and brought to trial. W. A. Haines, Troy, Ohio, attorney for Miss Putnam, made a plea in behalf of his client. He said she was a victim of the men who engineered the scheme to blackmail Mr. Bushnell under threats of criminal prosecution under the Mann act, the same to be based upon Bushnell's alleged arrangement for Miss Putnam to journey from Los Angeles to Texas to meet him. He said Miss Putnam was but a tool of the men and that she was coerced into acting with them in furthering their scheme. He said she came from a prominent family whose reputation is of the highest. In the courtroom at the time the defendants were given sentence were John M. Cole, Springfield, and Andrew Iddings, Dayton, Ohio, attorneys, who were retained by Mr. Bushnell to assist the Government officials. They, however, took no part in the proceedings. Among others alleged to have been implicated with Miss Putnam and Don Osborn, who is said to be her uncle, are R. G. Madson and J. A. Ryan, who are said to have been with them at Springfield when the alleged attempts to blackmail Bushnell were made, and Albert S. Harris, Hollywood, Cal., who is in Hamilton County Jail, having been arrested three weeks ago following a third attempt to blackmail Bushnell. According to officials, Harris sought to obtain $25,000 from Bushnell to cover cash bonds for $10,000 for Osborn and Miss Putnam for their release from Miami County Jail, and to pay their expenses out of the United States. Matson and Ryan have not been apprehended.

March 7, 1924 LOS ANGELES TIMES Ohio Blackmail Ring is Exposed

Twelve letters said to have been the basis of a blackmail plot against John L. Bushnell, Springfield (O.) banker and son of former Gov. Bushnell of that State, were seized yesterday by agents of the Department of Justice in a room at 744 South Bonnie Brae, according to Agent O. E. Meehan. The seizure followed the arrest of Lawrence McClean by city police as a burglar suspect, and his asserted confession, to the surprise of the Federal agents, that he was a member of the blackmail gang. He had not been suspected, it was said. The confession, according to Meehan, involved R. G. Sheridan, alias Blackie Madison, recently arrested in Los Angeles and now on his way to Cincinnati for trial, and others now under indictment in the United States District Court at Cincinnati. By means of the letters, Meehan said, the gang extorted $10,000 from the Ohio banker and made attempts to obtain $100,000 and then $30,000 more. Bushnell had been tricked into paying $10,000 for a package of blank paper, the agent said, and instead of meeting further demands sought the indictment of the gang. The letters are asserted to have been written by Bushnell to Rose Cooley, alias Rose Putman, who formerly lived at 2775 Beechwood Avenue with her uncle, Dan Osborne, alias H. L. Putman. The woman and Herbert I. Ross were convicted recently at Cincinnati, Meehan said, and are serving sentences at Atlanta penitentiary. A sixth member of the asserted gang is being sought by the Federal agents. McClean is said to have told Agent Meehan he had been worried by the arrest of Sheridan and decided to make a clean breast of all he knew. He will be arraigned today before United States Commissioner Long.

The First Fictionalization of the Taylor Murder


The first fictionalization of the Taylor murder was published less than two weeks after the murder, when the following story by mystery writer Isabel Ostrander was syndicated to many newspapers.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

February 14, 1922 Isabel Ostrander MILWAUKEE JOURNAL

Detective Story Author "Solves" Taylor Murder

(Isabel Ostrander, world-famed author of detective stories, has written a novelette based on the Taylor movie murder, in which she uses her detective ability to work out in fiction her "solution" of the mystery! This story was written by Isabel Ostrander after careful study of all reports of developments in the Taylor investigation. It is the first time such a story has been done by a famous American author so soon after such a tragedy. Is Isabel Ostrander's solution right? Has the author of The Primal Law, The Clew in the Air, The Step on the Stairs and other mystery stories, worked out the correct answer?)


-------
"What's the real dope, chief?" Capt. Hoey of the homicide bureau asked as he and his superior skimmed in a swift little runabout over the road toward Hollywood. "I know that Fowler was the theatrical wizard of his day and this new play he was about to produce has been hailed as his crowning triumph, but where did he come from?" "That's a nice little lead, Hoey, but it won't get you anywhere," the chief replied dryly. "It happens that about fifteen years ago John Evans Fowler was Jordan Everitt Foster with a family and a swell social position. We dug up his picture from the morgue this morning, sent out broadcast at the time of his disappearance. It had me going until I got in touch with Frisco and learned that his family and former associates had been wise to his change of name for a couple of years and had let him slide. There's no mystery there, no suggestion of enmity or financial trouble, no woman in the case." "There have been plenty since," Capt. Hoey observed. "They were plumb dippy about him, especially the three that he made famous. He never seems to have fallen for any of them, though, or a bullet might have reached him before it did last night. He made a star of Justine Reverre, turned Pierrette Howard from a rough soubrette into the cleverest comedienne on the screen today, according to the critics, and put Winnie Willis in the forefront in the ingenue class. They were all to be in this new picture, weren't they?" "And all three of them were out here at his dinner party last night," Chief Newton nodded. "That doesn't prove anything, though; Reverre is wrapped up in her career, Pierrette makes her way with no favors and little Winnie Willis has announced her engagement to that young millionaire, Jason Brooks." "Who else were in the party?" asked Hoey. "Only two actors, newcomers to the company, but there was one uninvited guest who put in a tardy appearance; at least, he was seen sneaking out of the back door by Mrs. Maxwell--who has the next bungalow--immediately after the shot was fired, and two minutes later another neighbor met him three blocks nearer the trolley line." The chief's tone was significant. "Both of them recognized him as Oren Beach, a fellow who sponged on Fowler for months and then forged his name to a couple of checks. Fowler forgave the first offense but when the second check turned up he swore out a warrant for Beach's arrest. Looks like an open-and-shut case to me when we land him." "Why didn't Mrs. Maxwell start an investigation when she heard the shot?" Hoey was discreetly noncommittal. "Thought it was the backfire of one of the motor cars," responded his superior, adding, "Here we are." The announcement was superfluous as he pulled up in the space which had been kept clear for him before a pretty, low-roofed bungalow snuggled between two more pretentious ones in the heart of the colony, for a milling crowd of men and women were surging about it and a score or more of cars were parked along the boulevard. "Get the furs and the diamonds!" Hoey remarked in an undertone. "Looks like a society crush." "Well, it ain't," his companion retorted. "They're the top-notchers of the movie world, though. Come on." The front door at the left of the veranda opened as they elbowed their way through the crowd and a distinguished looking man with iron-grey hair appeared on the threshold. Capt. Hoey whistled softly. "That's Paul Benedict, the traction king! What is he doing here?" "Backing the new film; his first theatrical venture, I understand." The chief added as they mounted the steps: "Glad you received my message, Mr. Benedict. This is a mighty bad business." "It is horrible, almost unbelievable!" the magnate replied in a low, shocked tone. "Young Brooks has been waiting with me in the dining room; in accordance with your orders we have not entered the study where poor Fowler was killed and the three ladies of the company who dined here last night are upstairs, I believe." "All right, Mr. Benedict. We'll join you and Mr. Brooks shortly." The chief turned to his subordinate. "Go in and have a look around, Hoey." He handed the other a key, motioning toward a door at the right and the detective entered. A chair had been overturned, a sinister stain clotted the rug between it and the desk and just at his feet the rug itself had been doubled back. A shimmer of white showed beneath it and Hoey stooped for a moment before advancing into the room. Some twenty minutes later he emerged and quietly letting himself out by the front door he skirted the house, examining the ground with each step. Re-entering the house once more he came upon a negro manservant, who started violently. "You are Hiram Timmons, Mr. Fowler's valet?" he demanded without preamble. "Yassuh, ah' cook, too. He lives--I mean, he lived--real simple out here ceptin' when he gave a dinner like last night and then the caterers come, but I done got 'em all out befo' I went home myself." "The guests had all gone, too?" Hoey persisted. "Tell me the order in which they left. Who went first?" "The two gentlemen, suh. Then Mis' Reverre and then little Mis' Willis. Po' Mistuh Fowler was just escortin' the last one, Mis' Howard, to her car when I started for home aftuh puttin' the study to rights." "Did you see anyone outside?" "Nossuh, nobody but Mr. Oren Beach, who used to visit Mr. Fowler." "Then you know him?" "Reckon I does." Hiram's tone was scathing. "Spent mos' of my time pickin' up his cigarette butts all oveh the place!" "Then you ought to know what brand he smoked." Hoey laughed indifferently. "Done roll his own, in brown paper!" The cook-valet sniffed and then cocked an anxious ear upward. "Spec' one of the ladies havin' hysterics!" An unmistakable sound of feminine weeping had drifted down to them and in another moment Hoey had sprung lightly up the stairs and knocked upon the door from behind which it came. A soft, reluctant footstep reached his ears and the door opened to reveal a demure little blonde with tear-drenched eyes. "Oh, please let me go home!" she wailed. "This dreadful place will drive me mad!" "In just a minute, Miss Willis," Hoey replied gently. "You dined here last night. Did Mr. Fowler escort you to your car?" "Yes. The--the very last thing he said to me was that he was going to be proud of me in his new production! Oh, I can't bear to talk about it! He-
-he was almost like a father to me!" She broke into tumultuous sobbing once more and the detective could get nothing further from her but he had seen enough to satisfy him. Tapping upon the door across the hall he found himself confronted by the wide-eyed, piquant face of the comedienne, Pierrette Howard. There were traces of tears upon it but she replied to his questions in a low, steady tone. She had been the last of the guests to leave on the preceding evening, had remained for a few moments to talk over her part. The tragedy was naturally a frightful shock to her, for she and Mr. Fowler had been the best of pals for ages. No, certainly there had never been anything of a sentimental nature between them. Was she at liberty to return to her home? As she asked the question a masculine voice sounded from below and she shrank back, shutting the door almost in the detective's face. He shrugged slightly and turned to a door at the end of the hall. A contralto voice in tones of studied tragedy bade him enter and the stately figure of the famous star, Justine Revelle, arose slowly from a couch. Her classic but somewhat mature features were as immobile as though carved in marble and they did not change as she assured her questioner that she had looked upon Mr. Fowler as the master who had revealed her genius to the world when she had all but given up hope of recognition. It was evident that she meant to talk of nothing but herself and Hoey at length withdrew and descended to the dining room. There the chief presented him to a tall, narrow-shouldered youth with a vapid face upon which an expression of stunned horror was stamped. Jason Brooks hadn't known Fowler, poor chap, very well, but he admired him immensely. No, he had not been invited to the dinner, but had spent the evening at the club as the doorman, stewards and a dozen of his friends could testify. "And you, Mr. Benedict? You did not dine here either?" Hoey turned to the traction king. "No. I remained in my own rooms as my man will tell you," Benedict replied, taking a handkerchief from his pocket and rubbing it nervously between his hands as he spoke. "I had some important papers to look over--!" "Very good, sir. Chief, Mrs. Maxwell and the other witness were right." Hoey turned to his superior. "Oren Beach was here last night." "I told you it was an open-and-shut--" Chief Newton began but paused at something in the other's expression. "He was here but outside the window of this room, looking through that door which leads into the study. Here are six stubs of his own peculiar cigarettes which he smoked there while he watched a scene in which he had no part. Mr. Brooks, you have loyal friends who will swear to your alibi but you dropped half of one of your cuff links as you crouched beneath the desk in that room last night. Its monogram is identical with that of the old- fashioned seal you are wearing on your watch chain." Brooks cowered back, his ashen face suddenly gray. "I swear--I swear I didn't kill him!" he gasped. "I was jealous, foolishly and without cause, and I came to have it out with him but I didn't fire the shot--I didn't even know who did! I slipped in while he and Miss Howard were talking in the dining room and hid under the desk when he escorted her out. Someone else came in and I thought it was he returning, but it--it wasn't. From where I crouched I could see only the feet of the intruder, but they were not Fowler's. He came in a minute after, though, and without a word the shot was fired and he fell. The--the other man went out at once but it seemed ages until I could get up courage enough to go, too, and slam the door behind me so that the spring lock would catch. I did not even have a revolver with me--" "It is an odd coincidence that your name and that of the man who watched outside would have commenced with the same letter. Beach and Brooks--and Benedict." Hoey wheeled suddenly upon the latter. "Be careful, Mr. Benedict, that when you put that handkerchief back in your pocket it remains there and does not fall to the floor as another one did last night; another with an initial identical with that on the handkerchief you are holding now!" As he spoke he whipped from his own pocket the square of white linen which he had picked up from beneath the edge of the rug in the study and the chief lunged forward with a hoarse cry of warning as the financier reeled. Recovering himself he extended his hands with a slight smile and disclosed in the folds of the handkerchief which he himself held a tiny, gleaming instrument like a miniature hypodermic needle. "This one was not empty, you see," he remarked quietly. "I came prepared and when you entered the room just now I knew from your face that the game was up, but I hardly expected you to work so fast. Never mind why I did it, nor why a man of my years who has never known love for a woman before should wander into the field of the films to find it after all the tinseled sham which it is! Young Brooks here could not have fired the shot from beneath the desk, of course; you deduced that from the angle at which the bullet was sped. I do not regret." His voice had weakened all at once and he felt blindly for a chair into which the chief assisted him. After a moment Benedict went on: "I am going now, I think. It was fate that we should have the same initial letter for our surnames; of course it had to be one of us three!"

January 24, 1914 MOTOGRAPHY In a recent play put on by Henry McRae at the Universal ranch, a soldier was told to throw a bomb at a certain time. When the time came Mr. McRae instructed his company to keep their positions by shouting his usual "Hold it." The soldier took this to himself and the bomb exploded in his hand. It was fortunately a "prop" bomb, but even then it singed his eyebrows and hair.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

April 24, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD What might have been caused the Francis Ford company of Universal players to turn their heads and hide their faces with dread when Miss Essie Fay, who is the only one who goes into the lion's den at the ranch, was caught in the trap-door as one of the lionesses made a spring for her. The cameramen who were outside the cage threw rocks at the old lion, but missed a shot and hit a lioness, who instantly became enraged and jumped for the girl. She sprang to the door and as it closed the body of the animal hit it and hastened its closing, smashing her hand in the crack and badly bruising it. She tugged it out, only after the huge paw of the beast had barely scraped it.

May 16, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Closely following the death of William Warner Kirby, the actor-trainer, who died of blood poisoning caused by his being mauled by a lioness, the beast was shot, at the order of the officials of the Universal Company. The unfortuante happening will no doubt serve as a sinister example in future handling of these dangerous felines.

June 5, 1914 VARIETY Dustin Farnum, long a hero on the legitimate stage, enrolled himself as a real (also reel) hero at Escondido, Cal., when he saved the life of Miss Winifred Kingston, his leading woman. Miss Kingston was participating in the making of the photoplay, "The Virginian," when she missed her footing and fell into a river at a point where the water ran to a depth of 12 feet. In the fall she struck her head against a piece of driftwood and was stunned. Farnum, who was only a few feet away, hastily cast off his coat and plunged into the water, swimming to shore with the actress on his back. A great crowd of onlookers had gathered to see the pictures players at work, and wild cheers greeted the leading man's act of heroism. It is doubtful if Farnum ever received a bigger "hand" in all his career as a matinee idol.

July 25, 1914 MOTION PICTURE NEWS By an accident Porter Strong, of the R. B. Film Corporation Comedy company, was run over by an automobile. According to the script, there was to be an explosion, the hood of the machine flying off. Strong, who was standing in the machine, should fall forward onto the radiator; and the machine start forward. Everything worked out correctly, except the fall by Strong, who went on over and could not get out of the way of the machine. The fly-wheel caught on Strong's clothing, and for a moment--while the auto was passing over him--members of the company thought it would be necessary to pick him up in a market basket. Aside from bruises he was not injured.

July 25, 1914 MOTION PICTURE NEWS In the filming of "Even Unto Death," at Catalina Islands, this week, Miss Dot Farley, leading woman of the Albuquerque Film Company, was washed off a large rock by a big swell at an unexpected moment, and when the motor boat captain near by at the time refused to drive his craft among the seal rocks, fearing it would be dashed to pieces, Director Gilbert P. Hamilton jumped in and rescued the popular picture star. Miss Farley was unconscious for some time after being rescued, and by members of the company it is considered marvelous that she was rescued because of the whirlpools between the rocks and the strong undertow. Twice Mr. Hamilton was sucked down in whirlpools, and both times was battered against rocks. As a result his legs were badly bruised and cut in a number of places.

August 16, 1914 NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Cleo Madison continues her fine work in "The Trey o' Hearts" and steadily refuses to have any "double" to subsitute for her. The result is that she is getting more than her fair share of misadventure. She came perilously near to drowning recently when the boat she was supposed to push through the breakers and so escape turned turtle and she could not get from under. Wilfred Lucas, George Larkin and the other men present went to her rescue and she was unconscious when pulled to shore, but she did the "retake" the following day despite protests. Her work in "The Trey o' Hearts" puts the stamp upon her abilities.

September 5, 1914 MOTION PICTURE NEWS Henry Walthall and Fred Burns, as commanders of the Ku-Klux Clan, in the filming of "The Clansman," by D. W. Griffith, put on the most exciting chase seen, near Whittier, last week, when the horse Walthall was riding ran away. Because of his weak condition--having been out of the hospital for but a week following a serious illness--the favorite actor could not control the charger. Director Griffith and Cameraman G. W. Bitzer were ahead in an automobile and the machine registered a speed of forty-three miles per hour for fully a mile. Fred Burns, formerly head cowboy for Buffalo Bill's Wild West, finally caught the horse Walthall was riding and was able to stop it before the actor was injured. In the scenes taken at Whittier 175 horses and three hundred men were used.

September 12, 1914 MOTION PICTURE NEWS Jack Kerrigan is hobbling about the big U studio on cutches, following a scratch on the foot and the development of blood poisoning. But Jack is not allowed to take a vacation because of the need of crutches. Director Jacques Jaccard was horrified when he learned of the condition of his lead and furthermore saw a week's lay off for himself and company. Then he began writing a scenario for a picture in which Kerrigan could use his crutch, swollen foot, and general illness to advantage. The company is producing "The Proof of a Man," and many of the players about the studio think Kerrigan is merely acting with his crutch. The picture is laid in Chinatown of San Francisco.

September 19, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD D. W. Griffith has a sunburned pate. What caused it? Well, to get the proper atmosphere for "The Clansman" he shaved his head to show his good faith in getting the men who worked in the picture to cut their locks. He wears a hat without a crown, and of course without his hair he became well burned while directing out under the sunny California skies. He puts cold cream on it every night, but no grease paint.

December 26, 1914 MOTION PICTURE NEWS Dorothy Gish, the Griffith-Mutual star, in full view of the studio crowd at Hollywood was struck by a racing automobile and dragged over forty feet before the big machine could be stopped. Her horrified friends rushed down the road to her, found her unconscious, and among those who helped lift her into the ambulance when it came was D. W. Griffith, who has done so much to make the younger Gish sister a popular star on the Mutual program. The director rode to Los Angeles with her, and her many other friends followed her there as best they could, by trolley, motor or carriage, as the case might be. At the hospital surgeons discovered that the little Mutual star had had her left side very badly torn and one toe cut off. It looked like a very bad case, but after several hours she began to rest more easily, and when Mr. Griffith finally came out and announced that she would live, but that it might be several weeks before she would be able to work again, Dorothy Gish's friends breathed a sigh of deep relief.

December 26, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD The crisis was passed in the siege against typhoid-pneumonia which Ford Sterling was waging with his great constitution, and now the popular comedian is past danger, but he looks rather battleworn, for he lost close to 22 pounds in the fight for his life. He will be out again in a few weeks and back to work.

"PERFECT CRIMES? Nickell/Taylor" by Ray Long

In mid-September 1999, Bruce Long contacted me asking if I'd allow him to give my e-mail address to a documentary producer based at Santa Monica, California. The unsolved murder of William Desmond Taylor was to be the subject of his production. Several days later I was contacted by this producer. At first I was hesitant to divulge what knowledge I might have about the case. After some prodding, I acquiesced and let the proverbial "cat out of the bag." I was then asked to do an on-camera interview which I agreed to do on October 8 during one of my periodic visits to the Los Angeles basin. During the interview, I made several statements which would prove erroneous. I had ASSUMED that Ms Gibson/Palmer/Lewis conducted herself in an ethical manner during her lifetime with the exception of a brief lapse on February 1, 1922. That was a big mistake. Subsequent revelations proved contrary. It now appears that some of my assumptions were inaccurate. Where I assumed that she had changed her name in 1917 for professional reasons, we learned that she'd been arrested for prostitution and vagrancy (working in a house of prostitution). Despite overwhelming evidence of her guilt, she was acquitted by a jury (reminiscent of the Simpson jury?). Regardless of the outcome of that trial, she could no longer appear in front of the camera as Margaret Gibson (her birth name). I gave this interview prior to revelations in the January 2000 issue of Taylorology. Whereas I assumed that she'd been infatuated with the director, it now appears more likely that she had attempted to blackmail him because of his sexual preferences. With the events at the Saint Francis Hotel over the Labor Day Weekend 1921 painting the public press bright pink, it would appear that she seized this opportunity to threaten the director with exposure if he didn't meet her demands. And it would appear that Taylor declined to meet those demands and was taking steps to see that Ms. Gibson-Palmer enjoyed an extended stay at the Hotel Gray Bar. We also learned that Ms Gibson-Palmer was arrested in 1923 on a Federal charge for being part of a nation-wide extortion ring. The case was dismissed after the Federal Attorney learned that the complainant and principal witness might have violated the Mann Act by transporting Ms Gibson/Palmer across a state line into Mexico. In the "moral" climate of 1923, this alone should have been the coup de grace to Gibson-Palmer's theatrical career. Somehow, her filmography continues into 1929. Several errors crept into the documentary and I don't know their source. Contrary to all known biographies, according to a 1900 census document furnished to me by the Denver Public Library, Margaret Gibson was born in Kansas, September 14, 1896. "Rounding up the Law" the film she made with "Big Boy" Williams in late 1921 was not a serial. It was a five reel "oater" filmed in Weir Canyon on land which is now the bottom of the upper Hollywood Reservoir. Several scenes were shot along Dark Canyon Road which is now Barham Boulevard. The town scenes appear to have been shot at Mixville. There are several scenes which could have been shot in front of any house in Hollywood during that period. Margaret Gibson's first theatrical appearance was at Alex Pantages' Vaudeville house in Denver, Colorado during the spring and summer of 1910. She would have been fourteen years old. During June of that year, Taylor appeared on the stage of the Tabor Grand Theater just down the street. She migrated west to Santa Monica California in 1912. Her mother appears to have been a "stage mother" and just as much a buzzardess as Charlotte Shelby. Interestingly, Taylor appears to have found his way to Thomas Ince's beach front facility in Santa Monica also in 1912. By the time she reached the age of 18 on September 14, 1914, she'd already played opposite William Desmond Taylor in four films for Vitagraph. How she supported herself over the years, I don't know. The parts she played in her post-1922 films probably required no more than a couple days at most to film. Working in one or two films a year didn't provide her with much income yet she resided in a relatively affluent neighborhood and enjoyed the fruits of a higher standard of living. We can only speculate. Was she engaged in prostitution? Narcotics? Extortion? We'll probably never know the answer. However, something very traumatic happened to her in 1934. She suddenly found it necessary to flee the country taking the proverbial "slow boat to China." Actually she went to Singapore in the Straits Settlements. She had no money yet on February 9, 1935, she married one Elbert E. Lewis who happened to be auditor for Socony Vacuum Oil Company (Mobiloil). It would appear she met Mr. Lewis on the dock as her ship arrived in Singapore. For the next five years, she enjoyed the "good life" accompanying her new spouse as he traveled around the Bay of Bengal from Ceylon to Borneo. For the era, they enjoyed a standard of living which would be the envy of a potentate. However this wasn't to last. In late summer 1940, she developed a serious bladder infection that could not be treated in India. She did not wish to return to the United States for treatment. However, because of the war, Europe was out of the question. And with German surface raiders operating on the Indian Ocean (they'd already sunk one of the company's tankers) both Australia and South Africa were out of the question. Therefore she had no choice but to return to the United States traveling on Lewis' passport via Yokohama. (Pan American offered Clipper Service between Manila and San Francisco but she was afraid to fly). Elbert Lewis was killed around March 15, 1942 during the bombing of a Socony Vacuum facility. Pat Lewis subsisted on a small pension from Socony later Mobil until her death in 1964. In 1949 she purchased a small house in Beachwood Canyon near the village with funds she received from Elbert's life insurance policy. An act of war clause voided the insurance, but Mobil paid it anyway. During the fifteen years that I knew her she was reclusive to the extreme. Looking from hindsight, she must have been hiding something. She was a very kind and considerate individual. Much of her time was spent gardening which she allowed vegetation to totally obscure the front of her home. Her only companion was a dark grey cat named "Rajah." Now, there are more questions than ever. The first being the reason for her flight from the United States. She appears to have had another nom de guerre: Ella Margaret Arce. Could she have used this name during the early 1930s? What about Edward King? He was a peripheral LAPD investigator during the early phases of the Taylor homicide. In 1930, he authored a magazine article which implied that Charlotte Shelby was the culprit. [NOTE: The rest of this paragraph should be disregarded. Ed King is not Eddie Baker.--Bruce Long] He was a sometime actor performing under the name Eddie Baker. In 1924 he appeared briefly in the film "Hold Your Breath" with Ms. Gibson-Palmer. He was the very first secretary-treasurer of the Screen Actors Guild. And for fifteen years he resided directly across the street from Ms. Gibson-Palmer. There was precisely one digit difference in their respective street addresses. Among Pat Lewis' papers, there is an envelope postmarked January 1941. Written in pencil in what appears to be her mother's hand-writing is the home address and home telephone for "Sanderson." Leroy Sanderson handled the Taylor investigation for the LAPD from his office on the second floor of New City Hall between 1937 and 1941. Why? At barely five foot, she was a mite of a woman but she could sure get herself into some mighty big trouble.
