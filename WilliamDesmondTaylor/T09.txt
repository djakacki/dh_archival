Primary emphasis will be given toward reprinting, referencing and analyzing source material, and sifting it for accuracy.
***************************************************************************** Mary Miles Minter was one of the central personalities in the Taylor case. The press details of her 1920 legal battle with the American Film Company give some interesting insights into her personality and the atmosphere of the era.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 18, 1920 LOS ANGELES HERALD Trial of the breach of contract suit of Mary Miles Minter, asking $4125 alleged to be due her in back pay and expenses, and the counter-suit of the American Film Co. demanding $102,523 damages claimed to have been suffered through her failure to appear in a projected picture, was scheduled to begin before United States Judge Trippet today. Involving many ramifications, among them the question of the film star's exact age, the trial, which is to be before a jury in the federal court, is expected to reveal many interesting sidelights on the financing of moving picture stars and productions. The complaint in the suit sets forth among other things that Mary Miles Minter's real name is Juliet Reilly and that her mother's name is Mrs. Pearl Miles Reilly. According to the allegations of the suit brought by the star, under the terms of a contract with the American Film Co. she was to receive $2250 a week for a period of two years, but on various occasions received but $1125. It was for the payment of the alleged withheld salary that Miss Minter has brought suit. In justification of her claims it is set forth in the star's complaint that the company did not provide directors suited to her abilities and that she was compelled to work day and night on location in violation of the eight-hour law. In the counter-suit brought by Attorney H. W. Bodkin for the American Film Co., it is claimed that the company suffered a loss of $100,000 in prospective profits from a projected picture starring Miss Minter. In addition, the company claims that it had expended some $2522 in purchasing a scenario, hiring actors and other incidentals to the making of a picture. The failure of make this picture, it is related in the complaint, was solely due to the fact that Miss Minter refused to work during the last two months of the period covered in her contract. Previous to this time, the cross-complaint states, Miss Minter would not work regularly, sometimes failing to appear more than two days out of the week. The question of the age of the little star is due to come up in connection with the voidability of the contract made with the company. At the time the contract was made in April, 1917, it is said by Miss Minter that she was less than 18 years old. That the burden of proving her age will rest with Miss Minter was the contention of the attorneys for the company.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 19, 1920 LOS ANGELES HERALD More than a hundred celebrities and near celebrities of filmdom thronged United States Judge Trippet's court today when the breach of contract suit of Mary Miles Minter against the American Film Co. actually went on trial. A jury composed entirely of men had been selected to hear the evidence in the case, in which it is claimed by the screen star that the company owes her in the neighborhood of $5000 for back pay and expenses. Mrs. Pearl Miles Selby [sic], mother of Miss Minter, was the first witness called to the stand to testify today. Asked concerning the reason for her daughter's failure to appear for work on various occasions set forth by the company, Mrs. Selby [sic] declared that in nearly every case it was due to a toothache.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 20, 1920 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER The American Film Company deducted $187.50 for a twenty minute period in which Mary Miles Minter curled her shampooed hair, according to Mrs. Pearl Miles Reilly, her mother, who testified yesterday on behalf of her daughter. Attorneys W. J. Ford and H. G. Bodkin, representing the defendant company, claim that Mary had too much "temperament" and ignored the directions of the general manager which required all actresses, including stars, to be on duty as early as 9 a.m. They have subpoenaed Margaret Shelby, Miss Minter's sister, to testify today.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 20, 1920 LOS ANGELES HERALD First hand details of how a toothache affects a screen star's "temperament" were given by Mary Miles Minter in the trial of her breach of contract suit against the American Film Co. in United States Judge Trippet's court today. There was also testimony given by Miss Minter on temperament and its place in motion picture work. That the manager of the American Film Co. does not agree with Miss Minter's views was a deduction to be drawn from her testimony. Miss Minter described a scene outside the scenario of the picture she was making between herself and Mr. Neil when she was late on the "set" one day because of trouble with a tooth. On this occasion the witness testified she had not slept the night before and felt a "perfect fright." "Can you describe Mr. Neil's manner when you came on the set?" Miss Minter was asked. "I don't like to do that," she demurred. "Well, just tell how he looked?" her attorney urged. "Oh! He made me so nervous. He looked at me just as if I were a criminal. I felt like screaming," Miss Minter declared. Then it was that Mr. Neil, according to Miss Minter, said that this "temperament business is all a joke." And furthermore declared that he didn't believe that the star had any more toothaches than he had. Finally, the witness said, in order to please the manager she asked her director to take a few scenes. She said that all the time they were taking these scenes Mr. Neil stood on the "set" in a "threatening attitude." During a conversation between herself and Mr. Neil while on the "set" that day Miss Minter testified the manager said to her in dramatic tones: "No work, no pay." Her mother heard this remark the star testified and answered it, "All right, no pay, no work." "What effect did Mr. Neil's presence have on your ability to work?" the star was asked. "Well, it got to be so that when I looked at him that I just thought I couldn't stand it." During her testimony, Miss Minter referred frequently to her director as "Lloyd." Judge Trippet finally asked Miss Minter to whom she referred as "Lloyd." "Why Mr. Ingraham," responded the witness. "Do you usually refer to people by their first names on the "set"? she was asked. "Oh, yes! Everybody calls everybody by their first name," Miss Minter declared. Further reference was made by Miss Minter to her tooth at another point in her testimony. She declared that owing to the fact that she was unable to go regularly to the dentist the tooth broke off. "The doctor was absolutely amazed," Miss Minter declared, "that anyone would take the responsibility of endangering her health." Miss Minter then told the jury that owing to the fact that the tooth broke off she had to have a "false gold thing" put in its place.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 21, 1920 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER ...Miss Minter, who is represented by Attorney E. A. Meserve, testified the director was just as temperamental as she was. "What do you mean by temperament?" asked Attorney Joe Ford, representing the American Film Company. "If you call the arguments growing out of daily associations, temperament, then I suppose I had temperament," said Miss Minter. She also tackled R. R. Neils, general manager of the American Film Company. She said he was very domineering and impressed his dignity by such orders as the one he issued to stars and others to be at work at 9 a.m. A good part of the day was taken up in explaining the work on some pictures. Miss Minter stated she had been delayed on occasions by improper instructions to her, and by her desire to make up properly and in the most artistic fashion. She also said her absence on certain days with the company was due to a toothache, but that for a whole week she suffered rather than ask Mr. Neils for permission to leave. Defense Attorneys Ford and Bodkin made efforts to establish whether Miss Minter laughed in the camera in a picture purposely to spoil it because she had been called to work early. They called Allan Forrest, an actor, to testify regarding the incident, but he stated he did not remember. Miss Minter denied she laughed in the camera to spoil the picture.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 21, 1920 LOS ANGELES HERALD ...Miss Minter admitted that on many occasions during her work with the American Film Co. at Santa Barbara she went home at night to cry herself to sleep. The crying episode was revealed when her attorney asked what effect the friction between herself and R. R. Neils had on her. "Many, many times I went home, threw myself on the bed and cried myself to sleep," Miss Minter testified. "Well, do you ordinarily cry easily?" she was asked. "No, I'm not the crying sort," answered the witness. I don't like people who cry," she added. Then Miss Minter was questioned concerning a checker game episode in which the members of her company were the players. According to the story told in court by Miss Minter, the checker game was in progress during an interval in the filming of the picture. The witness said she was suddenly startled by a "bing" on the back of her chair. Then she said she heard Mr. Neils say: "Miss Minter, I command you to stop playing checkers." At this point the witness declared she screamed she was so nervous. The witness was then asked if it was the custom for actors to play checkers on the "set" when they were not engaged before the camera. "Oh, yes," answered Miss Minter, "it is quite the custom for them to play little games between times. "Sometimes the boys shoot craps and the girls did embroidery or read." Another incident described as being one of the causes of her troubles with Mr. Neils, the manager of the American Film Co., was the filming of a scene under too many lights. On one occasion Miss Minter testified that there were two or three times as many lights used as were necessary and that she was forced to rehearse before them, which she declared is contrary to the usual custom. That night the witness stated she went home completely blinded. During the night she testified she awoke and thought hat her eyeballs were being burned out. The entire family had to get up and care for her, Miss Minter declared. Before leaving the stand today Miss Minter was questioned by Judge Tripped as to whether she stopped working for the American Film Co. because she had been offered another contract with another company. Miss Minter declared that she did not have another contract in view at that time.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 22, 1920 LOS ANGELES EXPRESS ...Dr. Nathaniel F. Hirtz, dentist, called at the request of Miss Minter, was the only witness called during the morning session, and the most minute details of dental work, past, present and possible future, were disclosed in questions asked by Attorney Meserve, representing the star, and Attorney Ford, who is conducting the case for the film company. During his testimony the dentist declared that Miss Minter's teeth were in bad condition during the period in which she claims that she was forced to call a halt in her film work because of extreme suffering, and technical charts and explanations were offered in substantiation. ...Letters relative to the company's attitude on Miss Minter's absence due to the work, written by her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, to Dr. Hirtz, were also introduced.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 25, 1920 LOS ANGELES HERALD That 9 o'clock in the morning is a "reasonable" hour for a screen star to begin work was an opinion given in the breach-of-contract suit of Mary Miles Minter against the American Film Co., on trial before United States Judge Trippet today. This opinion was given on the witness stand by R. R. Neils, general manager of the company, who declared he came from the East and found Miss Minter's company "loafing on the job" at Santa Barbara. Following this discovery, Mr. Neils testified, he made a rule that all members of the company must be on the "set" ready for work at 9 o'clock in the morning. The first day following the issuing of this edict, the witness declared, Miss Minter was late. He said that he waited on the "set" for her to appear and that she did not get there until 10:30 o'clock. "Miss Minter," the witness related he said to the screen star, "It is now 10:30. You have delayed the company one hour." "Who are you?" was the haughty response Miss Minter made to him, according to Neils. The witness said his orders for punctuality on the part of Miss Minter brought forth the remark from Mrs. Shelby, the star's mother, that the American Film Co. was a "tin can factory" and that "pictures cannot be produced by putting in time." The manager of the film company said he explained to Miss Minter and her mother that punctuality on the part of the star was necessary because her pictures were costing twice as much as they should. Lewis Victory Jefferson, a scenario writer, was the first witness called today by Attorney W. J. Ford for the film company. He told of a scenario known as the "Missing Woman," purchased for Miss Minter, but objected to by the star and her mother on the grounds that it was "immoral." Jefferson said owing to Mrs. Shelby's objections, the alleged "immoral location" in it was taken out, but that it still did not satisfy Mrs. Shelby. A council between Mrs. Shelby and the scenario staff of the company was described by the witness. "Did she appear angry?" the witness was asked. "Yes. She appeared to be intensely angry at us personally and individually," was the reply. "What did she say?" demanded Attorney Ford. "She said she would not put it on at first, but later added, 'All right if I have to, but God pity it, if we do.' " The scenario writer was asked if Mrs. Shelby used any profanity in her remarks at that time. An objection to the question was sustained by Judge Trippet. Another scenario written by himself had previously been submitted to Miss Minter, according to Mr. Jefferson. He was asked whether it caused any ill feeling toward Miss Minter when this was rejected. "No," responded the witness, "if we sell one story in 10 we're lucky." When R. R. Neils, general manager of the American Film Co., was called to the stand he stated that he had been general manager of the company for eight or nine years. He said he came to California from Chicago, the company's headquarters, to get better "efficiency" at the Santa Barbara studio. On his arrival, he said, he found the company to be "loafing on the job." Part of this was due to the lack of punctuality on Miss Minter's part, he testified. [A series of courtroom sketches accompanied the article.]
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 26, 1920 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Echoes of the war were heard yesterday in the suit of Mary Miles Minter against the American Film Corporation. Miss Minter last week charged that the film corporation would not let her participate in war films and protested against her work in Liberty Loan drives. R. R. Nehls, general manager of the film company, occupied the stand and vigorously denied that the film company protested against Miss Minter's activities. He said: "Miss Minter was in the Fourth Liberty Loan drive. She spent three weeks on the drive. During those three weeks we were not only paying her a salary of $2250 a week, but she was worn out the week following and we gave her another week's rest at the rate of $2250. "In addition, we were paying the salaries of the other members of the company, who could not act during Miss Minter's absence. Miss Minter led the public to believe that she was giving her time for patriotic purposes. She got all the credit--at the company's expense--and we got none of it. "When the flu period came along and all the studios were closing down we told Miss Minter if she would close down her company we would extend all the contracts after the flu period to cover the time we were closed. She said she would be willing to close providing we paid her the $2250 a week while we were closed. I told her I did not think it very patriotic of her, because all other companies and directors were closing and extending their contracts to cover the loss. However, she refused, and so I told her that she and the others would have to work if they were to draw their salaries." Miss Minter became very indignant during this testimony and wanted to speak, but her attorney, E. A. Meserve, motioned her to be quiet.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 26, 1920 LOS ANGELES HERALD The United States district court of Judge Trippet was converted into a film theater for a moment today while judge and jury were shown a picture of Mary Miles Minter registering horror in a bedroom scene. At the request of attorneys for the American Film Co., which is being sued by Miss Minter for $5000 for alleged breach of contract, the blinds were lowered on the courtroom windows while a projection machine threw a picture of the star on the wall. Several lengths of reel revealing Mary Miles Minter clad in boudoir garments were shown in an effort on the part of Attorney W. J. Ford to prove that the screen star laughed in the wrong place and ruined that part of the picture. Details of how the picture shown in court was taken were revealed by Lloyd Ingraham, Miss Minter's director. He testified that the scenes had to be taken over because the star did not follow his directions. On cross-examination by Attorney Meserve for Miss Minter, Mr. Ingraham admitted it is not at all unusual for scenes to be taken over in the making of a picture. He was then asked if this was frequently owing to the fault of the star. "Yes," he answered, "they often cut capers in the making of a picture." According to Mr. Ingraham Miss Minter warned him before starting work that morning that the scenes would not be good if he made her work. "If you make me work today you'll surely have to take the scene over," the witness testified Miss Minter said to him.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 27, 1920 LOS ANGELES HERALD "Mary Miles Minter went at me in the fashion of a cat, knocked a checkerboard high in the air and a cigar out of my mouth, and made three personal attacks on me," R. R. Nehls, general manager of the American Film Company, testified in the court of United States District Judge Oscar A. Trippet yesterday, where Miss Minter is suing for $4125 back salary she says is due her. The company claims $102,000 damages because of the alleged refusal of the star to complete her contract to work when told to do so. The case will go to the jury today, it is expected. Miss Minter's alleged attack on the film company's general manager occurred, he said, after the players had been ordered to cease playing checkers on the set. The company's game board was removed, but Miss Minter brought her own, he asserted.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 28, 1920 LOS ANGELES HERALD Mary Miles Minter is victor in her suit against the American Film Co. for back salary. The jury in the court of United States District Judge Oscar A. Trippet awarded her $4000. She sued for $4125. The jury by its verdict decided that the film star was obedient to the orders of the company. Earlier in the day Miss Minter won another victory over the company when the court nonsuited the company's claim for $102,000 against the actress on the ground of a violated contract. Miss Minter proved she was absent from work on the days mentioned because of a toothache.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * June 3, 1920 LOS ANGELES RECORD Rumors that Mary Miles Minter is 26 or 27, or any of a dozen other ages were definitely set at rest last Thursday, when a jury decision in Judge Trippet's federal court put it on record that the Realart star reached her 18th birthday on April 1, 1920.

Evil Hollywood

February 9, 1922 DETROIT FREE PRESS There seem to be two ways in which the Hollywood situation may be handled by the producers. One is by cleansing the colony so effectively that the world will believe it is purified. The other is by uprooting it from the face of the earth. On the whole the latter course seems much the simpler.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 26, 1922 OMAHA BEE Drive Garbage Element From Movies Protesting the alleged scandalous actions of certain movie stars in Hollywood, the Motion Picture Theater Owners' Association of America has issued the following statement: "There should be some effective way to remove the garbage element from the producing end of the motion picture business. The elimination of the dirty birds who have befouled the high positions into which the theater owners and public boosted them must be accomplished in some way. "The odium of their malodorous conduct falls on the theater owner and this polluting group must no longer be permitted to hang their smeared linen on this exhibitors' line. It must be made plain to the public that the theater owners are not responsible for the conduct of these human filth gushers in the industry, that we utterly repudiate them and demand their removal from every place where their foul presence tends to contaminate our business. "Now we have the Taylor murder with its divorce attachment, alias appendages, multiplicity of actresses, jealous and other scandalous circumstances involving well-known stars. The possibility of a well-known producer being mixed in confronts us and the whole mess of tragic obscenity is nauseating. [1] "The belief in some quarters that the motion picture business is on the one side festering with crass immorality and on the other distended with bulgy and bulky money bags makes it very essential that theater owners become alive to the situation confronting them. It must be emphasized that theater owners are not responsible for these conditions and that they will keep faith with the public, that no person tainted with scandal shall appear in actor guise or otherwise on our screens."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * April 1, 1922 MOVIE WEEKLY Dorothy Gish said the attacks upon picture actors and actresses have affected her keenly: "When I walk down the street nowadays and someone recognizes me, I feel like turning my head so that I won't hear them say: 'Oh, there's another one of those picture actresses. I wonder when her story will be told on the front pages of the newspapers.' "
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 12, 1922 NEW YORK TELEGRAM In Washington Representative Myron Herrick, of Oklahoma, declared the exposures justified his bill to prohibit beauty contests in newspapers to select moving picture stars. "Girls all over the country are longing to get into the movies," Herrick said. "And whether they succeed or not their minds are perverted and their morals loosened by what their favorite screen stars are doing." Herrick has introduced a bill to tax all moving picture producers and theatres fifty per cent of their net profits.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 10, 1922 Richard Burritt CHICAGO NEWS Lot, pleading to save movieland, would have cried: "Lord, will you spare movieland if a few players are found whose lives are above reproach?" Were the Hollywood colony in peril of the divine wrath, Lot would have to strike a sharp bargain. Many men have told me in all seriousness that movieland is a smear on American decency. Others who have followed the game closely for years have said that, were it not for the cleansing air of Southern California, the stench of the movies would asphyxiate clean-minded America.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 20, 1922 BUFFALO EXPRESS Speaking on the sanctity of human love last evening at the Central Presbyterian Church, the Rev. Dr. Robert J. MacAlpine, the pastor, said: "Untainted love is the divinest thing this side of heaven. But tainted love is born of Hades. It has disgraced Hollywood. It threatens the very life center of the film world. "The recent moral revelations in California's movie realm shocked the self-respecting world. But, had it not been for the death tragedies in star circles, there would have been no revelation and no shock. The unsuspecting public would have moved on in peaceful ignorance. And undisturbed the malignant virus would have still gone on eating its cancerous way into the body vitals of American life. "Did physical conditions exist with such destructive virulence, the state would long ago have quarantined the infested quarters and restricted the liberties of the infected parties. Public sentiment itself would have demanded it as a necessary protection to the health of society. Worse than such a pestilence has been running rampant in Hollywood. By accident, or incident, it has only recently been brought to light. And now no less is it necessary to protect society from its contagious germ. The whole cinematic bottom needs thorough housecleaning and disinfecting. If it doesn't get it, nothing short of moral disaster will follow. For, from the rotten source, the moral taint will appear on the screen in every city and hamlet in the land. If it be allowed to continue, society will pay the penalty by moral disintegration and decay. And this fair republic will reap the harvest of untold moral disease and pain and death. Nothing on earth is more certain."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 11, 1922 PHILADELPHIA RECORD Loose Los Angeles It is possible that within the limits of the city of Los Angeles there are some people of refinement who deplore the flood of notoriety that has come upon the place, culminating in the tidal wave that found its crest in the melodramatic passing of William Desmond Taylor--or whatever his real name may have been. But no one would be able to guess this from the news dispatches that have been pouring out of that storm center into every little backwater community that maintains a printing press. The voice of Los Angeles speaks through the megaphone of the movie director. The municipal authorities either sing small or take their cue from the dominant orator. The Mayor of the city recently felt it incumbent upon him to announce to the world, or to such small part of the world as might give ear to his words in the clamor of more interesting voices, that Los Angeles was proud to be the capital of the moving picture world. Proud? Of what? There is nothing in Hollywood that any reputable city might be proud of, except the money it brings to the neighborhood--and it is this money which is responsible for the evils of which Hollywood now stands convicted. It is remarkable that Hollywood should have any defenders at all; and yet one intelligent and sophisticated observer was recently moved to remark, in effect, that moral defections on the part of members of the movie world were no more worthy of reprehension than the forging of a check, or any other criminal lapse on the part of a clergyman would be. Again we come round to the eternal "root of all evil"--the love of money. Easy money, pouring lavishly into the pockets of those who have been unaccustomed to it, is at the bottom of the shame of Los Angeles. At Hollywood is gathered a vast colony of men and women who receive incomes out of all proportion to their intellectual merits. Flattery and admiration are lavished upon them far beyond their deserts. Their community has become, naturally enough, a nest of neurotic noxiousness. The whole place needs a healthy fumigation. There are among these men and women, to be sure, some worthy, self- respecting actors and actresses who should not be condemned with the majority; but they are, unfortunately, the minority. They were prompt to declare that Hollywood must have a thorough housecleaning, but, as we remarked above, theirs is not the voice at the megaphone. Unfortunately, too, most of us who prefer to listen to the voice of the movie director, and to the printed words of his abettors in certain newspapers, have large and furry ears. The public has been a good deal of a jackass in its unlimited adoration of the film stars; and so to that extent, at least, it is responsible for the present deplorable state of the community which the pious first explorers called the "City of the Angels."

A lot, according to the citizens of Hollywood, Ill., a placid little suburb of Chicago. Since the Arbuckle and Taylor cases were revealed the tiny Illinois town doesn't feel so placid. While it boasts of a movie theater, the Illinois Hollywood is innocent of Japanese butlers, love bungalows, Chinese dope peddlers and screen ingenues whose faces register "frozen horror." Because of the notoriety of the movie colony, the residents of Chicago's suburb today announced they would have the name of their town changed.

He demanded passage by congress of a resolution to investigate the film colony and prevent its scandals from debauching the mind of America. "Actors and actresses of the screen," he charged, "are teaching the public free love, adultery, murder, infidelity and lust. And," he added, "too many of them naturally are practicing what they teach. "The murder of William Desmond Taylor is another reason why Hollywood should be investigated," Chase asserted.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 22, 1922 NEW YORK TIMES (Albany)--Exchange of personalities between Senator Walker, minority leader of the Senate, and Canon Chase of Brooklyn marked the hearing this afternoon before the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. Pointing his finger at Senator Walker, Canon Chase said: "It's time that the people of this State were told how much you, as a paid representative of the movie interests in the Legislature, are receiving." "It's absolutely none of your business," replied Senator Walker. "Well, I think they are entitled to know how much you are getting from the movie interests," retorted Canon Chase. "I tell you it's none of your business what I get from the motion picture interests, any more than it is any business of mine what you get in your collections," Senator Walker exclaimed. "Remember, Senator, that you are a member of the Senate," said Canon Chase. "Yes, I am a Senator by election of the people, and not a self-ordained lobbyist like you are," replied Senator Walker. "I appear at this hearing as a citizen," Canon Chase said. "You've been here most of the time as a disturber," retorted the Senator. Then he talked about the accusation that he had received a salary from the moving picture interests. "Well, maybe I have bragged about it, as you say, and I'll brag about it from here to California and back, if I want to, but I want you to understand once and for all that it's none of your business how much I get," said Senator Walker. In addition to Canon Chase, Joseph Levensen, Secretary to the Motion- Picture Censorship Commission spoke. "If you think the present law is too weak," Secretary Levensen said, "then you can add a section which would give the commission authority to eliminate all movie stars who do not bear respectable reputations. I suppose if you gave us that power about 50 per cent of the stars would be eliminated."

February 10, 1922 Estelle Lindsey LOS ANGELES EXPRESS While Mabel Normand, in a darkened room slept the sleep of exhaustion A. McArthur, publicity director for the Sennett studios and the Cerebus at present standing between the star and the press, today dictated this statement: "Miss Normand and Taylor never were in love with each other. Why in the name of sense do the newspapers keep on harping on that silly stuff? "Miss Normand was never engaged to Mack Sennett and he never was jealous of Taylor." "Mrs. John Borden of Chicago, claiming to be a close friend of Miss Normand, claims that Miss Normand was engaged to Sennett," I suggested. "Then she was talking nonsense," was the emphatic retort. "I didn't mean to say anything further for publication, but I'll say that. All we are trying to do is to keep the poor little girl's name out of the papers. Every time it occurs in connection with the murder it injures her." "What about the statement of Underwood, arrested in Topeka? He says a woman killed Taylor. Has Miss Normand any theories on that subject?" McArthur turned about and made a gesture of utter disgust. "The poor nut," he blurted. "Underwood is crazy, bughouse. His statement is bunk, just bunk. "Honest, we are not going to give out any more statements for Miss Normand. We are not going to deny or affirm. We are tired, burned out. "Walter Underwood is just a poor boob. Why should we care what he says?" "Are you certain Miss Normand is asleep?" I inquired. "She should be," replied Mr. McArthur, peeping between some heavy velvet curtains that separated the living-room from a rear chamber. "Yes, she's asleep and I wish the gossip was as quiet. That's all. "For God's sake, keep the girl's name out of this mess."

--Movie Publicity Man in Recent Interview) The Publicity Man wore a pair of gumshoes [2] and his suit was the somberest black. He walked down the alley and looked all about that nobody followed his track. He had on a mask and his cap was pulled down and you never would know it was he. He came in the back door with a soft, stealthy step, as quiet as quiet could be. He looked all about and he stole up the stairs where the dramatic editor sat. His tread was so light and his knock on the door was the quietest rat-a-tat-tat. And the editor asked what the news of the stars, for he knew there must be, more or less. The Publicity Man whispered low and he said: "Sh-h-h! We are keeping their names from the press!" The Publicity Man had no picture or scroll or lay-out or story or such. He was mum as an oyster and still as could be with a blue pencil fast in his clutch. And the editor said: "I will run a weird tale of the slim stars and short ones and stout." The Publicity Man all a-tremble and pale, said: "Oh, Editor, pray, cut it out!" The the Editor said: "What's the matter, old boy? What's the which and the why and the how?" "The stars want a rest," so the other replied. "There is too much publicity now! We have had so much stuff of their furs and their gowns and their hair and their winning red lips. Till they're simply worn out with the strain of it all and just now all they want is eclipse." The Publicity Man gathered up all the stuff that the editor had on his hook And he looked all about and he whispered goodby with a frightened and furtive look. Then he put back his mask and he stole out the door and he dropped down a coal hole to hide. For the soul of the man was all stricken and sad, and all humbled and sore was his pride. Then he came out at dark and he gumshoed his way to the place where he wrote his weird stuff And he turned out the lights and he sat in the dark and he said: "I'm an old bird and tough, And I've seen some of life as it comes and it goes, as much as a man can, I guess, But I never once thought in the whole of my days I'd be keeping things out of the press."

They fear that with the revelations coming out of the mystery, the doings of other film actors and actresses may become known, and these are things that would wipe out many a fair reputation once they got into circulation. They fear that there might be some misunderstandings if the fans learned about those very free moonlight parties, sometimes held in the Beverly Hills district, where nymphs and naiads dance in costumes made purely of melting moonbeams.

With each passing hour a new suspect is placed upon this carpet and with each hour the police begin, all over again, a "gruelling examination." There is no one in Hollywood today who can claim to any position among his fellows unless he has been grilled most gruellingly. Outside of this grill room it is more difficult to find a policeman than a suspect. They have run to a convenient cover furnished by the united society of film magnates. In the evening, as I sit here writing this only true account of the famous case, I can hear the sh-shish-ing of these magnates and their corps of agents, a shishing that is proving very effective. Over the wave of slush, one might say, has come a wave of shish. No man dare say his soul is his own if that soul is under contract to the movies.

The police centered their search on meager clues that ended in blind alleys--mysterious pink nighties that disappear--initialed handkerchiefs that cannot be found--hints of secret loves of beautiful and unnamed women stars-- rejected lovers--scented love letters-- The chain is endless. Throughout Hollywood the great men of the industry were closeted with men and women idols of the screen, making every effort to hush up the scandal. Giddy parties in the fast road house resorts have been cancelled. The lights of the white light cabarets no longer shine on decolleted and shimmy loving women of the screen.

It isn't in human nature to resist such temptations. Neither is it done. Bear in mind that the invitation to irregular moral relations in this last related instance didn't come from old hands in the picture business, but from inexperienced beginners, many of them young women drawn from that very class which holds up its hands in holy horror of the goings-on of picture folk in Hollywood.

"In view of these facts, I ask that in future the word 'colony' in connection with the motion picture industry in Hollywood be banned." Two other words were asked to be placed on the taboo list as well: "Movie" and "lot" in connection with the studios here. [3]

February 10, 1922 TULSA TRIBUNE Doctors hurry, bankers worry, another movie murder threatens to tear down the assets of another line of movie reels. At twice the salary of the President of the United States the movie producers hire Will Hays out of the President's cabinet to lend a touch of respectability to a gigantic business that has lost its place of popular respect because it has deported itself in defiance of public decency.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 KANSAS CITY STAR Tricky Ways of the Hollywood Clues The difficulty that confronts the Hollywood police seems to be a superfluity of clues. If they had only one they might know what to do. Now, there's the handkerchief picked up at the scene of the crime, an initialed handkerchief, too. A beautiful clue, a favorite always. But the police no sooner start work on the handkerchief than a feminine garment shows up, pink, so we read, and marked with still other initials. This is confusing. Nor is that all; letters are found, and while the police are reading the letters the handkerchief disappears. Then while they are trying to find where the handkerchief disappeared to, the letters disappear. It is announced the letters have been returned to the writers of them, but the writers say it's no such thing, and again the police head swims. The thing threatens to become complicated. It's no longer a question of finding who fired the shot, not that merely; but who took the handkerchief and where did the letters go. In a way, it's a little unfair to the police. They doubtless are competent and prepared to work on a murder case, but no police anywhere is qualified to reveal the trick in professional sleight of hand. It's not their line. If they pick up a handkerchief, mark it Exhibit A and put it in the safe, that's their job done. They can't be expected to sit there and watch it-
-the murderer might get away. The letters, too; now we see them and now we don't. Pouf--they're gone. What is to do? If we were the police we'd shrug. The pink garment, we hope, is still there. It may turn out to be unimportant, but the authorities ought to hang on to something. With things disappearing out the window the way they do in that town, and everybody saying, honest, and on their honor, they don't know anything about it, evidence becomes of real value. Essential, maybe. Especially where there's so much one day and so little the next. That's why it seems one good reliable clue, one clue that would stay fixed overnight is what the police seem to need, rather than so many handkerchief, pink garment and letter clues that have no stability. No character, so to speak. What you might call Hollywood, or movie clues. Maybe a reliable or trustworthy clue is too much to expect in connection with a Hollywood murder, but even so the police have rights in Hollywood as well as the movies. If anybody tries to take that pink thing away, after all that's happened to the other clues, the police would be justified in demanding of such a person, or persons, what they want it for. That's the inflexible position we'd take if we were the Hollywood police--considering all the circumstances, that is, and not meaning to be harsh.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 26, 1922 NEW YORK TIMES Thoughts on Hollywood There is no need to accept the stories of "drug rings," "weird love cults," and other short words fitting easily into headlines which have come from Los Angeles since the last homicide in Hollywood. Perhaps they are true; probably not. Most assertions on any subject are untrue--especially in California, where everything is large, including the imagination of the inhabitants. If it is true that most residents of Hollywood make love carelessly, extensively, and without discrimination, it is because most of them know no other way to kill time. The same excuse could hardly be offered for similar offenders elsewhere. The pleasures of the senses are popular in Hollywood because most of the residents know no other pleasures--not, as elsewhere, because the pleasures of the intellect have been tried and found wanting. Hollywood's residents are certainly no worse than would be any similar number of attractive, uneducated young people who had suddenly come into great wealth and a peculiarly heady sort of fame. Most of us, in their situation, would do as they do; since we are not in their situation, but one materially far less prosperous, we make the best of our comparative moral grandeur. Because the temptations of wealth and luxury have never assailed us we fall on those who have succumbed. We may have done as badly with less excuse, but we haven't been caught; and if we were caught, we should never gain the unhappy notoriety of the rich and famous. So what we take out on Hollywood is our resentment, not at its wickedness, but at its wealth. We go forth joyfully to indulge in the national, perhaps the universally human sport, of kicking a man who is down. On vague, confusing and perhaps wholly unfounded suspicion we are willing to lynch a town and an industry en masse; and, as in most lynching mobs, righteous wrath is perhaps less potent than a sort of envy.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 22, 1922 BUFFALO NEWS The Movie Mind Take the word of Thompson Buchanan, movie playwright, all this pother over a murder and a scandal or two or three in Hollywood is but part of a clever plot. Wall Street has done it. He will not go so far as to say that the moneyed villains of Wall Street procured the murder of William Desmond Taylor. But Wall Street is behind the campaign to "blacken the names" of the producers and the actors. It was Wall Street that hired agitators to shout for a censorship. Wall Street plans to "ruin the industry and then buy in the wreck". Wall Street's ulterior purpose--but of course you have fathomed it already--is "to control public opinion, to make sure nothing antagonistic to its interest is uttered to the public." One of the dreariest of indoor pastimes is to dissect an asinine argument. The image of a malevolent, closely knit organization controlling the nation's wealth and plotting, plotting, plotting, persists in only a few quaint minds such as Thompson Buchanan's. It is equally obvious, is it not, that any group of investors who desired to buy movie companies could do so without any overwhelming difficulty? We suspect that there is not a financier of consequence in New York who has not been implored at one time or another to back or help this movie concern or that. The greatest companies are avowedly owned by bankers and their stocks are quoted daily on the open exchanges. And isn't it just like the want-wits of Wall Street to set out deliberately to destroy utterly the value of a million dollars' worth of films of some star who is working for them, or for their debtors? Why, then, all the space Mr. Buchanan got yesterday? Because Mr. Buchanan's mental processes so perfectly reveal what ails a great part of the movie industry. Read him and you understand all. You comprehend at last that the master minds of the movies are not osseous, as perhaps you had supposed, bus viscous, melting easily to a thin fluid when slightly heated.

A suspicion may lurk that life in the mountain regions of North Carolina is too tame, but we should think that after recent Los Angeles developments, a little tameness is what the moving picture world is in need of. The staged banquet and jazz party is going out of popular favor, but if some of that sort must yet be produced, the North Carolina mountaineer can supply a few bottles of the labeled "in bond" that would have a more riotous effect than anything they have been able to get out in California. So, they need not hold back on that score.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 10, 1922 HELENA INDEPENDENT Worries Los Angeles It is not surprising that every obstacle possible seems to be thrown in the way of the officers seeking a solution of the movie murder mystery at Hollywood. The salacious Arbuckle case and several other cases of less prominence, capped by the Taylor murder, has started an agitation in New York, where most of the big producers live, to have the California studios scrapped and the movie folk moved to Gotham, which doesn't mind a murder or a smelly orgy every day. Naturally, the Californians don't like the idea of one of the biggest industries in Los Angeles being moved away. Therefore, the big moving picture companies, which are reported to be exercising powerful influence to soft- pedal the scandal, are probably receiving much encouragement from the commercial interests of the city. To complicate the situation, Will Hays, who is soon to be the directing head of five of the largest moving picture producing agencies, is reported to have said that he will move Hollywood from California and set up the colony in New York. Hays is too much of a politician to make such a break, in our opinion. Even if he thought the idea a good one, he would never publicly advocate it, for if the plan is carried out, California would not go Republican or Democratic either in 1924. It would go crazy.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 8, 1922 Gil Cowan GLENDALE NEWS Los Angeles Mayor George E. Cryer in this morning's papers tried to drag Los Angeles out of the mud--but it rained. It seems that the Mayor thinks the movie colony is all right. He would have people believe that it isn't as bad as painted--but they paint too much in the movies. Without discussing the Taylor murder mystery, but bearing down on the conditions in Hollywood, or Califilmland in general, it must be said that there are a half dozen great big contributing causes for the bad repute which is to be eliminated by the industry. First--Discharge all of the low-brow hangers on, cousins of the director, friends of the star, or other persons who do not merit the positions they hold. This likely would reduce production costs 50 per cent. Second--Install managers who will not be subject to the petty politics of the studio and have absolute power over directors, stars and property. Many a dollar has been lost because of some crazy idea on the part of a director. Third--Instruct the publicity department to eliminate all salacious sayings in connection with problem plays; censor any sensuous "stills" and otherwise attract patronage on the merit of the complete film alone. Fourth--The State of California should have a law enabling it to deport undesirable citizens. Thousands of girls fling themselves upon the industry for support. Naturally, they are "cheap." There should be some way of sending them back to Kokomo and Kalamazoo. Fifth--But, but most important of all, there should be white men--real red blooded Americans owning and controlling the industry. A refined, educated person has no desire to enter the employ of the unscrupulous and money-mad who were brought up in the perverting influence of downtown New York, or some other salacious center. [4] Hollywood is pure, sweet, simple, wonderful--compared with the eastern environment picture people are forced into. If the calcium light must play on a dead director why not turn it toward some of the producers who are still alive and countenancing unsavory things about their studios?

Our eyesight is our greatest educator. So true is this that it has been calculated that not more than six per cent of those born blind actually attain sufficient character and mentality to become self-supporting! The "movies" are today a constant series of visual suggestions. And we are all creatures of suggestion! We are built-up largely by what we hear, feel and see. Those who have seen movies in the making know that the directors dominate the entire case, men and women alike. And it is a psychological fact that it would be easy for a strong director to carry this domination beyond the studio, for good or for evil. Every actor or actress is better or worse for the role he depicts. None can live two roles forever, even on the stage and off, and escape having them co-mingle, any more any more than Dr. Jekyl could escape from Mr. Hyde. Usually the evil overwhelms the good. There are two distinct kinds of pictures. Those that represent life as it is,--extol courage, honor, sincerity and the higher qualities of man's nature. These are undoubtedly beneficial, and are a source of great good to the community, and to those who make them. The other kind of pictures, appealing to mawkish sentimentality, extolling the pettier emotions of jealousy, vanity, the worship of brute force and the frequent misinterpretation of the true values of life, are a source of great mischief and lead to an entirely warped conception of society as a whole. This sort of picture sacrifices fundamental truths in order to appeal to false sentimentality. For instance, a handsome crook is shrouded in a cloak of romance. He is captioned "a gentleman crook," whose finer instincts remain unstained, although he transgresses every law. And those who uphold the law, are either held up to ridicule or an odious light. What is this but a very subtle justification of crime? The natural effect of this upon young and untrained minds is to confuse actual vice and crime with heroic glamour. The undoubted result of this can be no more than that many are led by these suggestions and false conceptions to a life of instinctive defiance to the law, or even into the commission of actual crime. The recent murder of William Taylor, with its sordid horror and morbid revelations, would doubtless serve as an excellent "super-release!" The romantic scenario writer probably would go as far as to concoct some theatrical justification for this crime, and strive to weave a halo of romance about the perpetrator, even to the extent of marrying him to the heroine! That's the psychology of "movie madness."

PAUL DISPATCH) Who killed William Desmond Taylor is a mystery as absorbing as anything Sherlock Holmes ever solved. Millions of people are more curious to know the answer to this riddle than about any of the great questions of the day. Some are interested in the rise and fall of stocks and bonds, the price of wheat, the Genoa conference, the next big fight or baseball dope, but more are watching developments at Los Angeles than are attracted by any of those other things. Every little bit of information so far deepens the mystery and whets the appetite for more. The "suspects" soon will be numerous enough to make a parade, eight abreast, which will be 10 minutes in passing "a given point."

It is not a new thing. One of the oldest and most curious chapters in human psychology tells how the successive popular idols of centuries have been "spoiled" until they lost their perspective. When Greek youths won fame in the Olympic games, no doubt there were successful gamblers who entertained them lavishly and silly women who went "crazy" about them. In Latin literature, there are many echoes of the applause given gladiators. If the truth were discoverable, it probably would be found that Sir Launcelot was as conceited as a Derby jockey of today, and that Sir Galahad spent as much time in front of a mirror as on his knees. A few centuries more and the "spoiled class" consisted of the mercenary chieftain, the condottiere. One need only read Venetian history to see how insufferable these popular idols became. The greatest condottiere of them all solemnly warned the Italian people never to give another man such favor as they heaped upon him: It was dangerous to the state. So the list might be followed to our own day. Contemporary America differs from other countries in earlier ages only in that, so far as one can see, they spoiled only one class, whereas America spoils a hundred. Whoever has his name often in the newspapers and frequently appears before the public is in danger of infection from the germ of self-importance. Escape from ruin may be possible. A cure is not.

But what does somebody want to find out? The government is not going to investigate unless there is a probability that a law is being broken by the industry, and so far while there may be a lot of individuals in the movies breaking laws, what is there in the recent cases of Arbuckle and Taylor for the United States to look into? Will actors and actresses be all of them asked if they smoke cigarettes and chew gum and dance? Will they be asked if they take a little drink now and then when they think the brand is safe? Will they all be asked if they have led strictly moral lives? Will they be made to tell the truth about their salaries?
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 10, 1922 KANSAS CITY STAR The Outrage on Movie Privacy The privileged class of Hollywood seems inclined to resent public interest in what that class regards as essentially a private murder. It is a view, of course, for which something may be said. Movie actors and actresses are entitled to preserve decently the privacies of family life as much as anybody. They are, in a sense, a single great family, as is shown by the fact that they leave their wardrobes around indiscriminately at each other's houses. Very well, then, if they are entitled to family privacy, is the public concerned in one of their own exclusive murders? It was, as all accounts show, conducted with entire propriety. It wasn't flaunted in the public's face nor committed in such a manner as to constitute a breach of the public peace. Except technically, of course. But what is meant is, that it was done quietly--almost with reserve. Indeed, the delicacy observed by the guilty person, the modesty and shrinking, ought to go far to disprove the charge so often made that the manners of moviedom are loud and vulgar. As murders go, this was a refined one. There was no public brawling, no public display of bad taste, no shocking public violence. It was a parlor murder, done in a private residence and apparently at a respectable hour. Moreover it was done upon a person of irreproachable public manners, of pleasing, even courtly, address--a gentleman if clothes ever made one. All the movie ladies said so, and even maintained it in strong terms, so we read, which again goes to show it. Thus it is established it was a private murder, a family murder, a gentlemanly perhaps even ladylike murder. And exclusive, it goes without saying. Such is the view held by moviedom, which inquires with raised and penciled eyebrows where the public gets in. Well, the public does seem a little abashed. It apparently had no idea when it first intruded what a private little affair it was. It had no idea it was going to run into pink initialed nightwear, letters hidden in the toe of a riding boot and other little domestic kickshaws of a light housekeeping character of similar nature. It was like blundering into a bathroom when it was in use. Unconventional in its own family circle moviedom may be, but the public, being perhaps a trifle narrow--provincial even--couldn't help but feel some embarrassment. To that extent, at least, moviedom does occupy the stronger position. It was the intruded upon, not the intruder. And its feelings, through strong, are not feelings of embarrassment. Its feeling seems to be that when the public looks at a movie pink nightie it ought first to pay at the box office. In a word, the movies resent their industry being commercialized to gratify public curiosity. It's being lowered, cheapened, vulgarized by an intrusive and prying spirit that respects neither privacy nor decency. This pink garment and these letters-- this murder even--were not for release. Still, the thing has gone so far now movie privacy probably will not be able to regain its countenance just yet. The public and the police are in, intrusively or not, and probably will insist on looking around a bit. The murder, private or not, is now public and the public will have its gossip. It may be demoralizing to a privileged profession--the talk, that is--but mystery murders are one of the public's weaknesses. Maybe the film industry will admit that; and if moviedom should happen to have any weakness of its own, it will understand how the public feels and try to put up with the annoyance.
