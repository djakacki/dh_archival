TAYLOROLOGY is a newsletter focusing on the life and death of William Desmond Taylor, a top Paramount film director in early Hollywood who was shot to death on February 1, 1922. His unsolved murder was one of Hollywood's major scandals. This newsletter will deal with: (a) The facts of Taylor's life; (b) The facts and rumors of Taylor's murder; (c) The impact of the Taylor murder on Hollywood and the nation; (d) Taylor's associates and the Hollywood silent film industry in which Taylor worked. Primary emphasis will be given toward reprinting, referencing and analyzing source material, and sifting it for accuracy.********************************************************************************************************************************************************** In late 1919, reporter Ray Frohman interviewed some of the top Hollywood silent film stars of that year. Seven of those interviews are reprinted below, to provide some background into the Los Angeles silent film industry in which William Desmond Taylor worked. (Frohman's interview with Mary Miles Minter, also part of this series, was reprinted in TAYLOROLOGY 32.)*****************************************************************************Charlie Chaplin December 2, 1919 Ray W. Frohman LOS ANGELES HERALD (When Charlie Chaplin, creator of ludicrous film divertissements that assuage the cares of a trouble world, was treated to a "pre-view" of Ray W. Frohman's interview with him for The Evening Herald--the first authentic interview Chaplin has granted for over two years, and the first dialogue between Chaplin and Doug Fairbanks ever recorded--Chaplin, the laughmaker, LAUGHED and said: "This is the first artistic interview I've ever had. "It is one of the very few articles ever written about me that really reveal me to the public." Blushing over the praise of himself he had read, the comedian added that "perhaps the writer was a little too sympathetic!" And then Charlie, who, as his "big brother" Doug says, "can't concentrate," pleaded to keep the "copy" "to read it again more leisurely so that I can enjoy it more.")If the KIDS could vote, CHARLIE CHAPLIN would be our next PRESIDENT! And if it's true, as Doug Fairbanks told Charlie in my presence, that in Sweden and Denmark, too, they consider Charlie in a class by himself, he may yet be King of Scandinavia! In fact, when the League of Nations gets to working and the Brotherhood of Man is a reality, my guess is that it's the internationally popular Charles Spencer Chaplin who'll be the first President of the World--in spite of his feet. Even at RIVAL studios, publicity men paid to lie for Charlie's competitors--if he can be said to have any--say freely, "Nobody's ever had the vogue that Chaplin has." The peerless Douglas Fairbanks himself says: "There is only ONE king in pictures--Chaplin; and only ONE queen--Mary Pickford. The rest of us must be content to be pretty good and compete with EACH OTHER!" No wonder my kneecaps vibrated as I chatted over an hour with Charlie Chaplin--and Doug Fairbanks, too, at the same time--out in darkest Hollywood. There we were, all in the same small room for one admission: Charlie and Doug and I--the king of comedy, the nonpareil light comedian, and a dictographic nonentity--talking our heads off, or, rather, talking Charlie's head off! Everybody knows Charlie joined Essanay in 1915, knows about his million- dollar contract with First National, and that he's now "one his own" and one of "The Big Four." Everybody's seen every Chaplin comedy from "The Bank," "A Night Out," "A Woman," "His New Job" and "Police" up through "A Dog's Life," "Shoulder Arms" and "Sunnyside." In fact, since they say "Chaplin doesn't work" and call his producing concern out on La Brea "the century plant," we've all been content to go to see him, and him alone, over and over again in the same films! So I didn't hash over with Charlie the well known facts of his pictorial biography. Doug and Charlie, with an occasional interpolation from me, talked and talked of Charlie's views on art and books and plays, on beautiful women and sunsets, on the Grand Canyon and whether or not a desert is beautiful, and everything else from cabbages to kings, from "Hamlet" to Doug's new funny overcoat; and on Charlie's professional methods and unprofessional soul--for he has one--and what he says he's trying to do to pictures and is doing and is going to do. And Eureka! Now I can tell the world for the first time WHY Doug smiles and smiles and smiles that famous smile of his! It's BECAUSE HE HAS PRIVATE "PREVIEWS" OF UNRELEASED IMPROMPTU CHAPLIN COMEDIES, every time he and his friend get together. For Charlie, I think most of us agree, on the screen is "the funniest man in the world." And at times during our chat he was twice as funny as that! And Doug--when he's "kidding" and playfully baiting Charlie and leading him on conversationally, or waxing Rabelaisian, or mimicking a noted English author for Charlie and then registering a lobe-to-lobe grin--is funnier than Charlie! And I might have been funny myself, for I was weak and helpless from laughter! Through the flimsy cheesecloth curtain of a window I saw for the first time--and recognized--the little smooth-shaven face of the off-screen Chaplin. It was thrust forward in a sort of cataleptic grin toward Doug, who was uttering one of his introductory "Do you know, Charlie's" in the deadly- serious resonant tones that he affects toward his little friend. "Hah!" quoth I to myself, waxing Shakespearian, "I have thee on the hip"--and I was upon them. It was the REAL Charlie Chaplin. I do not mean the Chaplin you see on the screen, the last of the royal jesters, with all of us as his patrons, the beloved vagabond, who has been paid the sincerest flattery, that of imitation, by more people than any other man who ever lived--by little kids all over the globe, by folks at masquerades, by "would-bes" on "amateur nights," by "rival" screen "comedians," both Caucasian and Oriental. That Charlie, with his most active flexible cane and his dogs, his oddest derby constantly being tipped to cops--until the psychological moment arrives--and to fair women, his trick moustache and his loose-fitting shapeless trousers, and the biggest feet in Filmland as well--that Charlie every man, woman and child under the stars knows. He has probably been kicked and shot in the pants--on the screen--more than any other living man. The camaraderie this humblest screen character displays toward policemen and burglars, until the moment arrives for him to destroy them--for he can pick up his feet quicker than any man in Shadowland--is world famous. A captivating smile, an artless blush--and then an agile hoof--is the way Chaplin on the silver sheet, broke in a saloon or restaurant, handles striking policemen before they strike. And you are aware how chivalrous he is toward the fair sex; how his matchlike--not matchless--figure, and his inimitable--not immaculate--garb have captivated many a beautiful heroine. He can get more fun out of stepping in a waste basket--but what's the use? You know him. Let it suffice to say that Chaplin's smirks, shrugs and sucking together of his cheeks, his characteristic Chaplinesque gestures, his personal accoutrements and mannerisms are the most individual, distinctive on the shadow screen. But those, as Doug opined to Charlie and me, are merely "the externals, the trappings" of his screen art. "Our most subtle comedian," he has been called by the critic of an eastern magazine, the veteran of a million reviews. "Vulgar," say some folks who have seen Charlie spout food on the screen amidst the medley of mock romance, mock tragedy, mock adoration, mock courtesy that he "spills" in the comedies he ORIGINATES. But no "highbrown" has ever been able to sit through a Chaplin comedy without bursting involuntarily into spontaneous "Hah hahs!" right out loud; and cultured, intellectual college professors--wasn't Professor Stockton Axson, brother-in-law of President Wilson, one of them!--have publicly proclaimed him an ARTIST. However, the Chaplin I talked with, as I said, was not the screen Chaplin. Neither was he the make-believe-real Chaplin who USED to talk to interviewers before he made all the money he wants and decided that he didn't need any publicity. That Chaplin, I have one of his intimates' word for it, used to turn on the phonograph in his room and chat engagingly, ALWAYS CAMOUFLAGING HIS REAL SELF. The Charlie Chaplin who talked to me is the real, honest-to-goodness, personal, unprofessional, actual Charlie Chaplin, I give you my word for it. He was as artless, as "off his guard" as a three years' child who doesn't know the camera's there when you snapshot him. Charlie, you know, when it comes to being interviewed--which he hasn't permitted for YEARS--is what Fielding's eighteenth century bailiffs would have called "a shy cock." When famous newspapermen representing papers from all over the country with President Wilson's party called on him. Charlie stuck his head in the door, took one look, said he "had to have some air," and "ditched" them all-- went out for an auto ride! When his own casting director, Edward Biby pleaded with him for an HOUR A MONTH for nation-wide magazine interviews, saying it would be worth a million dollars to Chaplin, Charlie merely waved a hand airily and said: "Oh, no, that's all right, that's all right!" But I found him a delightfully interesting conversationalist, a sensitive little aesthete who's well-read and well versed in art, a cultured little chap with artistic sensibilities, a rather deep thinker--though I won't vouch for the soundness of his theories--and withal a somewhat shifty or shifting one. Where the "shifts" came in, the mental sidestepping from one "highbrow" subject to another or from high to low, the "sacheting" to use a dancing term, of the gray matter in instinctive--and courteous--reaction to the conversation of others, were with Doug Fairbanks. For when talking with Charlie, the jovial "Smiling Doug" Fairbanks is not merely magnetic--he is HYPNOTIC! He holds his friend Charlie in the hollow of his hand. "I've been dreaming of London," mused Charlie, who was born near there only 31 short years ago and was in vaudeville there--for he became identified with the theater when he was seven years old. "I tried to show it to someone, but there was always fog or night or something--I couldn't show its beauties. But I would say 'WAIT--you'll see it.'" Charlie said he hasn't been back in dear old Lunnon since he attracted favorable notice in "A Night in an English Music Hall," as the lead in which he came to the United States before he made his picture debut, some years ago. But, pause! I didn't tell you how the real Charlie looks! He's a slender sapling, this artist in the neat gray-checkered suit and black knitted tie and yellow-tinted pleated shirt who lolled in a Morris chair chatting so naturally and vivaciously. He has curly black hair with touches of gray--a young man's gray--at the temples, and vivid blue eyes, and sensitive features like the person of high-strung temperament that he is. When he shows his perfect teeth in a grin--a charmed, fascinated, hypnotized grin--at his master, Doug, he has Lewis Carroll's Cheshire cat "backed off the boards." At times when his eyes shine and his face glows as he gets talking of his professional or aesthetic enthusiasms, Charlie becomes almost beautiful. And when he gets really "worked up," his disreputable LITTLE black shoes with they grayish tops twist, and his supple figure writhes, as his right hand helps him to express himself by graceful, powerful gestures. "I became a star when I'd been at Keystone SIX MONTHS," said Charlie in response to my question. "I was there about a year. No, that's not the world's record--with some people it takes only one picture. Look at the way Betty Compson's salary jumped after her work in 'The Miracle Man.' "Did I have 'awful struggles,' or fights with bosses to MAKE them star me? My struggles were over before I went into pictures." "After one picture the public fell on its face and worshipped him," said Doug. "I'm an admirer of yours, Charlie, even if you are a friend. And when I see you on the screen there's something goes from you to me, I feel an interchange. "It isn't what he DOES, or even how he does it, that makes you laugh," "enthused" Doug to me. "When you watch his pictures it's the human dynamo WITHIN that you see. And evidently what he's giving us is what the public wants." "What I put into my pictures is what I WANT to do," supplemented Charlie. "Before I went into pictures, I felt repressed, I wasn't in my proper sphere. Now for the first time I'm doing what I want to do. "I get a feeling, from a play or somewhere, and then THINK OUT WHAT I WANT TO DO." Sometimes, say folks at his studio, where his own people never dare disturb him when he's "on the set" or on the job mentally, Charlie sits for as long as eight hours in solitude thinking up something the world--for his audiences are numbered by the hundred million--hasn't laughed at! "I got a feeling from reading Thomas Burke's 'Limehouse Nights,'" continued Charlie, "and the result was 'A Dog's Life'--working it right out, going through natural experiences and having the consequent reactions. It is a translation, though not in Burke's language or style, of course. "There is beauty in the slums!--for those who can see it despite the dirt and sordidness. There are people reacting toward one another there-- there is LIFE, and that's the whole thing! "Look at Rabelais. Vileness? That's only his SUBJECTS, BUT--! "Writers have no STANDARDS of beauty. What IS beauty? It is indefinable! "Beauty is all WITHIN," continued Charlie after Doug quoted "Hamlet" by the yard. "I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAS EVER PAINTED A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN!" "Artists today put on the canvas a 'Follies' type--which people call beautiful. That sort of beauty is merely external. Look at the old masters, such as Van Dyke, and you see old women with their faces screwed up with wrinkles. It's the beauty that's WITHIN that counts." When Doug called him an admirer of Basil King's novels, Charlie did not dissent; and when Mark Twain was mentioned Charlie said: "Ah, now you're getting me back on my favorite topic. "I've been reading Waldo Frank's book of essays, 'Our America,'" continued Charlie. "He is DEEP! You think when you start out it's the ordinary fervor, but when you get into it--! And I caught something of myself in what he wrote about me." "Me, too," said Charlie, showing his dimples in a smile of assent, when Doug remarked that he thinks the mouth is the most expressive feature--though Charlie said he's seen some women with small mouths who were uglier than other women with large mouths. When Doug said to him: "You are not responsible for what you are able to do," meaning that Charlie's ability to produce mirth-provoking comedy is God-given, Charlie modestly remained silent, making a gesture of instant, impersonal agreement. Dimpling, he admitted that he "hates it more than anything else when they call me sentimental." Whether he meant in real life or reel life will ever remain an unsolved mystery. We talked of sciences. "A scientist must be a lover of life," said Charlie. Do you know that Chaplin has none of his excruciatingly funny stunts worked out on paper in advance, nor even the plot of his comedies prepared in "script"? He admitted it. "He takes an idea, a theme, and works it out by himself as he goes along," said his admirer, Doug, to his face, uncontradicted. "He's a remnant of an aristocrat going through all those adventures. Reel after reel WITHOUT SUBTITLES--ACTION!" "You are more HEART," returned Charlie, regarding Doug's screen work. And then Charlie sprung NEWS of a new departure in Chaplin comedies! Said he: "In the one I'm making now there's a whole reel of drama before I appear. I've got pathos, human interest, tragedy, humor--we've had that before--EVERYTHING in it! Yet it is all pertinent, constructive of the plot. It's a comedy DRAMA. That's what I'm going to do from now on. "Edna (Edna Purviance, his leading lady) is an OPERA SINGER in this one! I didn't have her commit suicide." It was a soul-wrenching effort NOT to call him "Charlie" but-- "Mister Chaplin," I asked, "isn't it a terrific constraint for a sensitive man of artistic sensibilities and tastes like you to play a vagabond, a TRAMP?" At that, Doug Fairbanks exploded: "Why, he's naturally a BUM!" said Doug, uncontradicted by the smiling Charlie. "When he has a clean collar on it's Tom Harrington (Charlie's secretary) who's responsible!" Entirely aside from his alleged bumminess, "Spencer," as Doug called him once, fervently declared that he LIKES the smell of idoform--"the hospital smell," as it is popularly known. He averred that the reason why people aren't particularly fond of the fragrance of the skunk is simply because their ancestors for generations haven't liked skunks, and they think of the odor that's going to get on them. "You," he added, turning to Doug, "are particularly sensitive of odors." But we were getting quite Rabelaisian, weren't we! Perhaps I'd better tell you at once that Charlie also talked familiarly of Bill Sikes and Nancy, and thinks that "Los Angeles will eventually be a great artistic center." And ONCE Charlie's eyes blurred. There were tears in them. The face of the man who, say some who know him, works not for money but as a creative artist, and plans to retire from money-making screen work in about five years, trembled with silent emotion--whether modest shame or gratefulness, I know not. It was when Doug quoted someone as saying that people regard Charlie as the one and ONLY, "than whom" there is no one like. Something about that tribute touched the droll comedian's heart. PRAISE OF CHAPLIN MADE CHARLIE WEEP! CHARLIE CHAPLIN became, for that moment, a TRAGEDIAN!* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Dorothy GishNovember 8, 1919 Ray W. Frohman LOS ANGELES HERALD WAIT A MINUTE--EVERYBODY! In the name of Steve Brodie, give me a chance to explain how I "took a chance." Which starry sister of the Gish constellation should we have in our series? That was the question. The vivacious comedienne? Or the ethereal tragedienne--whom even her sister says is "so beautiful"? "BOTH!" say you? Ah yes, but-- Separately, 'twould make this somewhat of a family party, wouldn't it? And together-- "How happy could I be with either, Were t'other dear charmer away." Torn between two such "winners" in the same story, who could do justice to either? SO--I borrowed a coin from the boss and gambled with myself: "Tails"--Lillian. "Heads"--Dorothy. You, dear readers, who may not approve of my consulting the fickle goddess, had a "sure thing"! Both the Gishes are young, both are talented, and both are beautiful. YOU couldn't lose! "Heads" won--and so you have today the story of DOROTHY Gish, that rollicking tomboy of the screen. Lillian, at least a thousand pardons! It's tough on both of us to miss you, but Dorothy "slipped in" a lot about you--and it's "all in the family" anyway. And now that everybody's happy, let's go. It may not be too much to say that Dorothy Gish is attaining the highest art, for she is acting HERSELF. As the Little Disturber in Griffith's "Hearts of the World" some two years ago--that queer, saucy creature with the flexible hips and the mannish swagger, now making a moue, now kicking up a wicked heel--the maker of stars, the general public, first really "discovered" Dorothy Gish. Ever since, much to her regret, she has been doomed to wear that heavy black wig, in hot weather, beneath powerful lights in interiors; and much more to her regret, she has been the girl clown, as she was in "I'll Get Him Yet," "Nobody Home" and her other starring vehicles. How does she do it? How is it that this dainty cameo, this normal slender, blue-eyed girl with the "humorous mouth" can play the harlequin so well? Here's the answer: She's a mistress of screen "business." True to the best clown traditions, Dorothy doesn't hesitate to make herself homely to be funny. But a "close-up of Dorothy in person, during and after rehearsal at the Griffith studio in Hollywood, and the yarn of how she got her start and how she "arrived," as told by herself in delightfully natural fashion reveals that not merely "getting the most out of" stage business put putting HER OWN SELF on the screen is what makes "Dot" Gish what she is today. For she is chic; she is piquant, she is "cute"; and she is not only as "cunning" as she can be, but as pretty as she can be--another living refutation of the popular fallacy that it is the photographer's art to which screen stars owe their loveliness. You'll find this natural comedienne--the sort of practical joker which your family and every family has in it--rehearsing before ever it comes under the camera her own interpretation of the good old "simple country maid coming to the city to go on the stage" motif, under the wing of her director, Elmer Clifton, with good-looking young Ralph Graves, ver-y villainous Charley Gerard and a vamp or two as fellow conspirators. She is wearing a simple, one-piece blue dress, white shoes and stockings, and her own light brown hair in a pair of curls over each shoulder, with hair-ribbons that don't match. Even her bangs are impromptu. Drag her out into the sunshine, perch her on a lucky soapbox, have anuzzer yourself, and she will tell you of her blighted life as follows: "I was chased out of Dayton, Ohio, a few months after I was born. Mother inflicted me on New York. "A friend of hers said that she (the friend) could play the maid in 'East Lynne' if she could get a child to carry on, and applied for me. Mother didn't like it, but we were rather hard up then and she let me go. "So, at the age of 4, I got my start on the stage on the road as Little Willie in 'East Lynne,' with Rebecca Warren. We opened somewhere in Pennsylvania. "I was in road shows till I was 9, playing child parts. One season it was 'Her First False Step,' with Lillian in it, too. Several years I was with Fiske O'Hara, the Irish tenor, and my last stage appearance was with him in 'Deacon O'Dare.'" Then the adorable Dorothy attended grammar school for three years at Massilon, Ohio, where she lived with her aunt, and one year at Allegheny Collegiate Institute, Alderson, W. Va., where the climate did such things to her that her mother and sister stopped and burst into tears at their next meeting. Reunited, the Gish trio went to Baltimore on a promised trip to New York for the girls, Lillian wanting to go on the stage again and Dorothy dittoing with all her might as she "had been on the stage so long." Whom should they discover on the screen in Baltimore, in a Biography film, "Lena and the Geese," but Gladys Smith! The girlish Gishes had been in plays with the "three Picks"--Gladys, Lottie and Jack. Dorothy tells the rest of the story thusly: "I called at the Biograph studio on Fourteenth street to see Gladys Smith. 'I guess you must mean Mary Pickford,' they said. Mr. Griffith said Gladys could bring her friends in--we were in the lobby, as you weren't allowed to go in--and I was introduced to him. "I thought he was Mr. Biograph, as he seemed to have the 'say so,' and I didn't catch the name. I thought there was a Mr. Vitagraph, too, as there was a Mr. Edison. "Lillian and I were both engaged as extras." This was in 1912, when Dorothy was 14. "Mary (Gladys) was leaving there for Mr. Belasco's 'A Good Little Devil.' Belasco's manager, Mr. Dean, had been the manager of Rebecca Warren's 'East Lynne' company when I was in it, and introduced me to Mr. Belasco. "Among us then, 'Belasco' was a name to tremble at, a god! I was so fluttered and fussed! He told me later it was the funniest thing he ever saw--Lillian and I kept trying to get back of each other. "'You don't want to go on the stage, do you?' he said to me. 'You want to go back to school.' I wanted to choke him--I thought I was so old. Lillian became a fairy in that show on the road. He 'didn't have any part young enough for me.'" When Lillian left this company to go to the Pacific Coast to go into pictures, Dorothy, paying her own way, and their mother had preceded her. Lillian received a regular salary playing parts with the Biograph stock company. Dorothy led a busy life as an extra: in the morning an Indian (a blue-eyed Indian) squaw, in the afternoon an Indian man registering a puff of smoke from his trusty rifle, later in the day a white lady in a sunbonnet. Then, at 15, she went back to New York, succeeded in convincing Griffith that she was worth $40 a week and first began to play ingenues. "My age was always against me--it was the worst thing I had to put up with," explained the veteran of 21 summers from her throne on the soap box. "They'd always say: 'You're too young--you can't act till you're 35.' "I wanted to be a tragedienne. I only wanted sad parts. When mother read the press notices when I was on the road, saying I was a 'comedienne,' the tears rolled down my checks. I thought comedians had to have black on their faces, or red beards, and weren't nice." Dorothy has followed the Griffith banner ever since her Biograph days-- into the Reliance and Majestic company, then into Triangle plays, where Lillian and Dorothy--still wanting to be a tragedienne--were "starred" in ingenue parts--and then out when he left. Then came New York for a while, Mr. Griffith going to Europe "to take some scenes in a war picture." Then Lillian, who had a contract with him, went to Europe with her mother. Later Dorothy was sent for. The result was "Hearts of the World." "I had starred before, and I'd had quite a few coming parts, but I wasn't interested in them," said Dorothy-o'-the-soapbox, discussing this turning point in her and her sister's careers. After this, including her present Paramount starring vehicles being supervised by Griffith, it was always comedienne and black wig for Dorothy-- the latter, perhaps, to help differentiate her on the screen from Lillian. "I used to 'kid' around at home," continued Dorothy, "and everybody would say: 'Why don't you play YOURSELF?' "'If you'd be yourself, instead of putting on all that heavy acting--' Mr. Griffith said to me. "It's hard to do! I don't know myself. I'm so young and self-conscious--though I've got over most of that. In all these seven Paramount pictures I HAVE been freer. I'd like to make people who see me in comic pantomime on the screen feel the way Mark Twain makes his readers feel. "BUT"--and at this point the Mark Twain "fan," who goes to the other extreme and likes Victor Hugo, too, swallowed a couple of dashes--"they make me play myself, and I wanted to be an ACTRESS!"* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Louise GlaumNovember 13, 1919 Ray W. Frohman LOS ANGELES HERALD "Vamps," they say, are "going out"--perhaps have already "gone out." But LOUISE GLAUM, credited with being the original screen vampire, HASN'T. Louise is "going full blast," blossoming more and more in every picture in the full luxuriance of her opulent charms. But not as a "vamp," as the term is popularly used. Louise is now a "vamp" with a moral, as it were. On the screen she's a misled woman who reforms in the fifth reel, or is hit between the eyes by the retribution to which the "vamp" in real life is heir. Thus, she is no longer a "vamp," but a "portrayer of emotional roles true to life." Why Louise has not been snuffed out, but continues to wax in reputation while "vamps" wane' what she herself things of "vamp" roles and their passing; and her own explanation of regenerated vamphood, as sketched above-- that you will learn in the course of human events if you read on. Alone, with no protecting escort of local Anti-"Vamp" leaguers, without a special leased wire to the police station, sans even a coat of armor, I tracked the original "vamp" to her lair! 'Twas at the Thomas H. Ince studio at Culver City, where by special arrangement J. Parker Read, her manager, is permitted to sick Louise on handsome leading man. I expected ponderous seductive charms of the boa-constrictor type. There are "vamps" and "vamps," of course, but "BEEF" predominates in the physique of most of the modern successors of the singing sirens who made Odysseus lash himself to the mast and stuff his sailor's ears with wax to sail the gauntlet at their isle. Instead, I found an attractive woman with an engaging manner positively naive, a charming unassuming woman with a personality, a robust young woman NOT AN OUNCE OVER WEIGHT! She was meekly sipping tea from a thermos bottle, as the last reel of a box lunch, in the seclusion of her dressing room, far from the madding and vampable crowd. And she was "FUSSED" TO DEATH! Honestly, she was twice as scared as I was! Even if I do say it, as I shouldn't. There was a hesitant little catch in her voice as, unaffectedly, she tried her faltering, modest best to give her testimony as to her "life and works." Her hands were clasped, instead of being outstretched for prey; and she rubbed 'em together hard and often in a smiling effort to tell "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth." But the poor girl--the brazen hussy who had "lured away" Charley Ray and "Bill" Hart and goodness knows how many more, many a time and often, upon the screen--was so "fussed" that she didn't have a date in her system! Of course it is historic, personal dates to which I refer. She has beautiful features, dark brown eyes to match her hair--which was blossoming in 999,999 little round curl-lets--rainbow-shaped eyebrows and a dimple in her chin that would have made St. Simeon Stylites climb down off his pillar and "follow her up." Even if Sim hadn't felt like "stepping out," I'm sure Louise would have Glaumed him because of her costume. It was a sheer chiffon house gown in two tones, wine color and yellow, cut rather low. That lure deadlier than T.N.T., a LEOPARD SKIN girdle, was caught over one perfect shoulder with a bejeweled oriental chain. Slippers and stockings of gold made her 100 per cent DANGEROUS. I persuaded Miss Glaum to take me out on her "set." We glimpsed an $8000 setting with period furniture said to have been owned by a princess, which Louise said she'd "like to move into." Beside the regulation "vamp" "prop," a gigantic polar bearskin, stood a sedan chair which Louise "wants to use as a private phone booth." And there we found our nook. It was a cozy corner in the lavish studio "set" adjoining, which Louise inhabits during her current picture; and gosh, it was dark! Facing the set's real stairs and real banisters--down which eight ladies had slid during the making of a wild night scene resulting from too much cider-"hooch"--Miss Glaum testified as follows: "I have only done a few real vampire parts, according to the figurative definition: 'One who lives by preying on others.' The term has been so misused that any woman who does anything a bit naughty is now called a 'vamp.' "If 'Zaza,' 'Camille' and 'Sapho' were done in pictures now, they'd call 'em 'vamp' plays; yet the greatest actresses played them and they were called immortal. They were true to life. "The women I now portray are bad to start with, but there are always that kind in real life--people who make a mistake, do wrong, but later atone for it. They are NOT vampires--women entirely bad. If a woman just makes a mistake unintentionally, I don't believe she should be condemned for it. that's what makes life interesting--people changing, characters developing. "The term 'vampire' may and should die, but heavy emotional roles true to life will never die--just as little curly-haired ingenues will never die. "I'm not conceited enough to say I originated the 'vamp' on the screen-- it's hard to prove that anything's first. "But about 1913, at Inceville in Topanga canyon, I first 'vamped' and first starred in my first five-reeler, when five-reelers were new. It was 'The Toast of Death,' Mr. Sullivan's first story for Ince. They started it as a two-reeler, then made it a five-reeler. "It was so successful that they had Mr. Sullivan write for me later 'The Wolf Woman,' since which I have always starred. "Young Charley Ray, who started at Inceville about the time I did, and whom I had led astray in several pictures, looked so pitiful in 'The Wolf Woman' when he killed himself after I turned him out!" So! This 'vamp' had a heart! And no wonder they starred Miss Glaum. Charley's so good looking that anyone who could vamp him--even on the screen--by that very fact would demonstrate herself to be the champion of sirens, the "vamp" of "vamps"! "The first thing I knew about being a 'vamp,'" Louise declared, "was when I woke up one morning to read a newspaper notice calling me 'the peacock woman' and a 'vampire.' The term wasn't used in titles, sub-titles or advertising, but was probably invented by eastern critics. I didn't mind the 'peacock woman' part of it, as I wore the first peacock gown on the screen, I think, and I have one in this picture, and I love peacocks. "My first big emotional role was in a picture called something about 'Ashes.' It changed my whole type of acting. Mr. Ince saw the possibilities in me, realized that I was better at that, and thereupon put me into dramatic work. From then on, I played emotional roles or 'heavies.' "I played a female 'Bill' Hart, with two little pistols, in 'Golden Rule Kate' before such roles were common. I played wicked dance hall girls, leading 'Bill' Hart astray, when dance hall girls were new. In 'The Aryan,' with Hart for Ince, I was the bad girl who pretended to be good. 'Bill' found me out and dragged me by the hair of my head." For about a year and a half after "The Toast of Death," which she said she'd "love to do again and make a big picture out of," and after which she always "vamped," Miss Glaum "alternated." That is, as Ince was not yet prepared to make features permanently, she played "heavies" with Frank Keenan as well as Hart. Twice, she said, she left Ince, but has "never been a success except on the Ince 'lot.'" Her first three pictures produced under her present 3-year contract with J. Parker Read are "Sarah," by Sullivan; "The Lone Wolf's Daughter," by Louis Joseph Vance, and "Sex," by Sullivan. Director Fred Niblo, handsome, curly-haired, pleasant, spruce, bowed himself into the party at this juncture. He's the hubby and director of Enid Bennett, you know. Anyhow, he tore Miss Glaum away from me to "vamp"--pardon me, to "baby"--William Conklin in a scene before my very eyes and those of Conklin's screen wife, pretty Myrtle Stedman. And she certainly did it! The seductive-looking Glaum, puffing at a cigarette, her mocking laughter rising above the "soft music" of a violin and portable organ, was alluring as the deuce! That is stating it mildly. Ah! The enthusiastic Mr. Niblo has restored the lost Louise to give the following resume of her earlier deeds: "I went into pictures because I couldn't get a job in stock here. Mother didn't want me to return east, where I'd been a stock ingenue, after my little sister died. We lived on Pico Heights. My home has been in Los Angeles most of the time, though I was born in the country near Baltimore, Md., leaving there when I was about 4. "After making the rounds of the studios for a few weeks hunting a job, I started at Universal at $35 a week, as ingenue lead in one and two-reel comedy dramas, not 'slapstick.' That was about a year and a half before 'The Toast of Death.' I played opposite Eddie Lyons. Lee Moran was working in those pictures. "I know I wasn't very good at first, but I seemed to get along all right, staying six or seven months. I was crazy to get into dramatic work, and had applied to Ince. When he offered me a contract as ingenue at $50 a week, I was the happiest woman in the world. So many were anxious to work at Inceville that I felt highly honored. "For about a year there I 'got by' in two-reel dramas--not my real line of work, though I didn't know it then. For about $75 a week I went to the Kalem company for four or five months, in which I cried nights for making such a mistake, being such a fool as to leave Ince. A raise means nothing unless you can progress artistically. "He took me back, very repentant. I stayed with him during the time he released through Triangle, and when he built and went to the present Goldwyn studio at Culver City. When he went over to Paramount, I remained with the new owners of his studio, and later I spent a year on the Brunton 'lot' on the Hodkinson program." Miss Glaum, who attended Berendo street school on Pico heights, said that she never studied for the stage. When about 16, she "left home" as ingenue with a cheap little road show, "Why Girls Leave Home." She got the job through an employment agency, without experience, and received $25 a week, furnishing her own gowns, which she made. Even now she designs her own unusual gowns, spending a large part of her salary for odd creations, including 20 changes in her current picture. After reaching her goal, Chicago, Miss Glaum played ingenues in the Imperial stock company there for a year and a half, playing in "The Lion and the Mouse" and "The Squaw Man," among other plays. Then, in a summer stock engagement in Toledo, she created the ingenue role in "Officer 666." Its author, Augustin McHugh, her stage director in Toledo, tried it out there before New York ever saw that successful farce. Miss Glaum's picture debut followed a few more months in stock in Chicago. "An odd personality, wonderfully easy to get along with," is what her manager calls the Glaum. "In full 'vamp' regalia, wonderfully hard to tear away from," I'll amend his motion. I DIDN'T get away till Louise had introduced me to and said a good word for everybody on the set, including her permanent and "most wonderful" camera man, courteous Charlie Stumar. "Remember!" said the original EX-"vamp," "I'm NOT 'vamping' nowadays, in the erroneous sense of the bad 'vamp.' I'm cold-blooded and selfish on the screen, but retribution comes and teaches a moral!" MORAL: Ain't retribution wonderful!* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *William S. HartNovember 6, 1919 Ray W. Frohman LOS ANGELES HERALD Buffalo Bill is dead. But Bill Hart still remains. And not even in his palmiest days--the days of his plainsmanship or the days of his showmanship-- did the famous former have an audience go great or a following so enthusiastic as the famous latter. If I expected to get a bullet through both ears and be snaked off my feet by a well thrown lasso, I was disappointed. For William S. Hart did none of these things when he greeted me. He just looked kind of "sad but determined," as though he were accused of being a stage-robber and didn't dare to defend himself. Bill Hart's expression in real life is very much the same as it is when you see him on the screen. He is just Bill Hart. What more is there to be said about it? Of course there is much more to be said about Bill, but about his appearance and his expression--not another word. And I'll say he's pleasant. Why, he didn't even knock me out and put his foot on my chest before inquiring my business! We have all seen in the films a rugged, gaunt individual with a face like a mule's, so "hard-boiled" of mien as to be almost beautiful; and we have seen this knight of the plains do goodly deeds until that face, reflecting his homely, heroic virtues, has registered kindliness, even tenderness. He isn't always a cowpuncher with a barking "gat" in each fist. Sometimes he's a lumberjack, sometimes he's a convict, sometimes a sea captain, or a frontier preacher; but usually he's an outdoor man, and always he's a HE-man, just as Galahad was a HE-man, virile and admirable. I found out lately whey those homely, heroic virtues o'erspread the face of the man who fittingly bears such sobriquets as "Blue Blazes Rawden," "The Tiger Man," "Two-Gun Hicks" and "Shark Monroe." It's because his intimate personal history--and his biography are as full of humble incidents and homely lessons as Benjamin Franklin's, and thrice as thrilling--shows that he himself HAS those simple virtues. When you hear "Bill" Hart relate unassumingly his experiences and beliefs, it's easy to understand how he "got started" and never stopped. This rough-and-ready terror of "bad men" I discovered in a regular civilized OFFICE at his studio in Hollywood, ready to pack up for going out "on location" in the Mojave desert for 10 days. He was wearing "store clothes"--a clean white shirt, neat gray pants, plain black shoes. The son of a gun, to use the language, of Windy Gap and Los Hope, Ariz., was actually riding a swivel chair! Unless you consider the lack of a coat and collar the mark of a plainsman, there was nothing of the wild and woolly about this quiet, polite gentleman with the light brown hair, determined frown, light blue eyes, high cheek bones, firm lips with thoughtful lines about them, and strong jaw. Except that he averaged one "damn" and one "hell" to the minute, he might have been his own gentle pinto pony with the feed bag on. You've got to go back into his history a bit to understand "how Bill Hart did it"; how this raw youth of 18, who had lived in Dakota territory until he was 15, playing, riding bareback and shooting with Sioux Indian kids, got his first stage job as a "super" at Drury Lane theater in London and a few weeks later lied his way to New York into his first part in a road show; and how he was first starred on the road in 1902 as John Storm in "The Christian." And then you'll want to know how in 1913, with an established reputation in Shakespearean and classic drama and later in western roles, he refused an offer to be featured in a Broadway production in 1914 to star, at less than one-fourth the salary, in his first picture with Triangle. Today, instead of being a star and leading man at three or four hundred a week facing an average audience of 800, he stars before from eight to ten million people a day in about sixty pictures being shown all over the world, with--he won't tell how much salary, "because I don't wish to bunk the public, and what's the difference? "I inherited what little stage ability I have," said Mister Hart. And if you'd talked to him you'd call him "Mister," too. "My grandfather on my father's side was one of the greatest criminal lawyers in England, John Gleason Hart. My father, Nicholas Hart, an Oxford man who came to Newburgh, N.Y., where I was born, when he was a young man, after going around the world before the mast, was a wonderful orator. "That's the best talent in the world to inherit for the stage. A great orator is necessarily a great actor. In his speech, his gesticulation, his graceful postures in delivery, you have the elements of acting. "From the time I was six months old till I was 15 we lived in Dakota territory. I was playing with Sioux kids at their typical sports while other boys of my age back in New York were playing baseball and football. I knew and loved there, as a boy, the western characters I played on the stage after playing Cash Hawkins in 'The Squaw Man' with Faversham in New York in 1905. "I'd ridden eight miles on a pony to a little Dakota school with five pupils, but I'd had little formal education when my parents took me to New York at 15. At public school they thought me stubborn--and I can hardly blame 'em--and had my father before the board of education to explain. "I had Indian habits. I wouldn't say 'Good morning.' If they'd talk to me, I'd turn and walk away, as an Indian does. An Indian doesn't say 'Goodby' or "Go to hell,' or anything. I was stoical. "My father, who was a highly educated man, decided I'd better be tutored at home. I was a big strapping kid, anyhow, among a lot of children. For a year and a half he 'crammed' me, and I passed the scholastic examination for West Point. You needed 70 to pass, and I got 70.20. "He ground it in, but I was always great on application--anything I went after I stayed with till I got. "I was crazy to go to West Point so I could get back West as an officer. I'd always lived near forts, and was familiar with soldier life. But my father couldn't get me an appointment, and I was brokenhearted. "I'll tell you a dramatic incident that changed my whole life just then--I've never told this to anyone, I think," continued Mr. Hart, his voice sinking to a whisper. "There was a wonderful bond of affection between me and my father. I made up my mind to run away from home. I went down to the East river and made arrangements with a captain to let me work my way to Australia. The boat was to sail at 5; I was to go on board at 4. I made it, all right, crawling past my parents door with my belongings in a bundle over my shoulder, but just as I closed the house door I felt a hand on the other side of the knob. "It was my father, in his nightgown. He questioned me, and I told him the boat would reach Melbourne in six months. 'All right, laddie--I'll meet you there,' he said--and he'd a been there, too. I went back to bed!" Then young Hart, who had been spending his spare quarters as a gallery god in New York, told his father of his ambition to become an actor. His Dad explained that acting was an art which called for culture and refinement and for which a raw prairie boy wasn't fitted; but that if he was determined, he should at least "break in" in Europe, seeing the best development of centuries and getting the rough edges off him. He especially advised him to learn fencing. But the elder Hart wasn't able to send him abroad, being just about to take his family to plunge in a far northwestern venture. So "Bill" worked his way on a cattle boat, received $4.85 at the end of the trip, walked 208 miles from Liverpool to London, and worked there till he saved up enough to take him to Paris. Noting the "Ici on parle Anglais" sign in a store, Bill submitted a little idea of his own--delivering parcels to people who spoke English--and delivered for four or five firms. His room cost him five francs a week. Mornings he washed windows and scrubbed floors at a fencing master's, to receive "wonderful" lessons after hours from an assistant whom Bill, who was always "handy with his hands," taught American boxing. Every night he went to the theater. In 14 weeks Bill went back to London and, being 18, tall and well made, without trouble got his job carrying a spear. In four or five weeks he went back to Liverpool--paying his fare this time--and was given free passage home on a cattle boat. "I knew I had to lie and I did," Mr. Hart explained regarding his landing his first part in New York. "It was a white lie. I told 'em I'd played in London. I knew only how to put paint on. "I got a job at $12 a week with Daniel E. Bandmann, on the road in repertoire, including Shakespeare and such plays as 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,' and in eight months I played 52 parts--juveniles, heavies, bits, old men, boys, everything. "How did I work up from that to become a star? The same way as others. It takes many years' service, and I suppose there must have been some ability behind it. It's ten thousand times harder to succeed on the stage, in my opinion. A picture star can be made almost overnight." After that first tour, Hart served his apprenticeship with Madame Mojeska, Julia Arthur and Madame Rhea, playing diversified roles, leads and heavies, in Shakespearean and classic dramas. Following his being starred in "The Christian," Hart was the original Messala in "Ben Hur." After his hit as "The Virginian" in 1908-9 he played principally Western roles. "You've got to keep attracting more attention," Hart continued in explaining his rise to stardom, "gradually getting better parts and better salary, always working hard and making good. Did I have to 'club' 'em into making me a star? Managers are not to be clubbed. If they want you, they want you, and you have mighty little to say about it; if they select you, you can go down on your knees and thank God they found you--that's been my experience." Walking down Euclid avenue in Cleveland, where he was playing in "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine," one cold winter night in 1913, Hart blew into a cinema house to keep warm. It was the first picture he ever saw. He was thrilled, and obsessed with the idea that his opportunity lay on the screen. Rejecting the offer to be featured on Broadway, he paid his own fare to California, and in 1914 began as the "star"--at only $75 a week--in his first Triangle picture, "The Bargain," with scenes in the Grand Canyon. He has been starring in pictures ever since. In 1917 began the William S. Hart Productions, Inc., for the Famous Players-Lasky corporation, including "John Petticoats," in which, as a Washington lumberjack, Hart inherits a modiste's shop in New Orleans, where scenes were taken. He is now working on nine special productions he is to produce himself, as his own boss and without limit on time or footage. And that's "how" the pleasant gentleman in the swivel chair--who could have shot the whiskers off my eyeball without touching the lid--"did it."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Ruth RolandNovember 7, 1919 Ray W. Frohman Los Angeles Herald No matter how many sweethearts you may have had; no matter how eternally faithful you may have been--in spite of everything and everybody--if you met Ruth Roland face-to-face, it's "off with the old loves, on with the new!" Nobody could resist that wealth of light brown hair, those great deep- blue Irish eyes--one hundred percent sparkle--those perfect teeth, that superfect profile--and then that coloring like the tints upon the hills of Fairyland at sunrise. Peep at Ruth Roland as "Belle Boyd," in her current serial, "The Tiger's Tail." It is made up of a succession of hair-lifting thrills. But, all murder aside, your Nick Carter days are indeed over and you haven't an "Oh, boy!" left in your system, if you can't get a kick out of the vision of Ruth Roland in riding trousers, jumping off a cliff into a tall, supple tree that bends over with her until she can be lassoed and hauled up again by her friends; or diving from a forty-foot precipice into the ocean an inch or so from where the rocky wall shelves out. (Don't be surprised if she can heliograph with a coffee can--she can do anything.) Better than this screen glimpse, come with me to the David Horsley studio, back of the Washington park ballgrounds, for a "close up" of Miss Roland in action, making the serial "The Adventures of Ruth," of which she is not only the star, but also the central figure of the subject matter, the director, the AUTHOR of the story, and the PRODUCER! "Yes, every nickel back of this is mine," she tells us. Ruth is "on the set" in a highly decorated kimono. It is a tense moment. Somebody is in the act of gagging somebody else, and Ruth has her trusty rope ready to finish the trussing up. She has just finished a fight with a 210-pounder who nearly tore her clothes off her back. You don't know whether they're going to tie Ruth in an airplane and anti-aircraft gun her, or seal her up in a submarine and blow her up; but one look at her self-reliant carriage and honest, "good scout" bearing, and you know that Ruth will win out. Even the desperate villain, whom she hit with a blackjack, begged her, sotto voce, to "hit me again!" Ruth is the pet of the studio, as well as the boss; the good friend of everyone from Business Manager Lionel Kent to Herbert (alias Handsome) Hayes, her leading man. "I hope they like me," she admits. "I try hard enough to make them like me." Her speech and her actions are rapid. She has a straightforward look. She might do for Galeta when Aphrodite has her almost thawed out for Pygmalion, but she's too much of a regular girl to be statuesque. There is no illusion about Miss Roland's beauty--it's a blessed fact. If you are one who builds a dream gallery of fair women, save the central niche in it for Ruth, and listen to her story. Ruth was born when she was 3 1/2 years old! That is, she went on the stage at that age; and since acting is the breath of her nostrils, that's saying the same thing. It was in a singing and dancing specialty in her native San Francisco, at the old California theater, with Ed Holden's juvenile "Cinderella" company. Her family was well known, her father being manager of the Columbia theater. Her mother was enthusiastic about the first appearance and gave her an "wonderful" dress, but was very anxious about the stage fright Ruth would have. Instead, Ruth had the time of her life! The audience applauded. Ruth kept on dancing. Her mother called to her repeatedly from the wings. Her dance was finished and she knew it, but the audience kept on laughing and clapping and Ruth kept on improvising--until they sent out a young man to DRAG her off. But let Ruth tell it in her own words, with an apology for talking about herself since she couldn't help it when being interviewed: "I was known as 'Baby Ruth,' and considered one of the best known child actresses at the time. I was in the Belasco and Morosco stock companies, and was featured in San Francisco as 'Little Lord Fauntleroy' and in 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.' "When I was 5 years old I was making $150 a week plus my own and my mother's expenses, featured on the Orpheum circuit. There weren't--and aren't now--many children they'd take. There was one other well known, 'Baby Lund.' She was the favorite in the east. I was known in the west as 'California's favorite child actress.' "I was the first child actress ever to play in Honolulu. I played there six months, and they went wild over me. Royalty entertained me." After playing children's parts and doing a specialty and being in vaudeville until her mother's death, when Ruth was 9, Ruth, who had been tutored while on the stage, went to a grammar school in Los Angeles for a year. At 10 she played a special engagement in San Francisco, doing a specialty in vaudeville, and then returned to school. At 12 she was the youngest student in Hollywood High school, her big Irish heart causing her to appear at all sorts of benefits. At the end of the sophomore year, when she was not quite 15, she left her aunt's home here to visit another aunt in Texas, intending to return. Instead, she went into stock in ingenue and child parts in El Paso. She continues the story: "Then I went out on the road. We had a lot of bad luck and a lot of fun--I was only a kid. We never got any salary except the first week's--and I spent all that for my aunt's birthday present--but it didn't matter. It was the nicest company--'The American Players'--everybody happy! I wouldn't take any amount of money for that experience. "I had also been on the Majestic vaudeville circuit, making two years in Texas. I wore my beautiful hair, which came below my knees, skinned straight back and parted, with two braids down my back. I wouldn't curl it--until I went into pictures." Now cometh Ruth's second "start"--this time in pictures. "When I was in stock on the road people kept saying: 'Why don't you go into pictures?' "I followed them on the screen. I saved my money on the road so I could have a good vacation at my aunt's home here--I was just a kid, and I'm an orphan. When my money was gone I applied at the Biograph studio--the biggest one then. This was in 1911. They took my name and address and phone number. I met Mr. Griffith. "Then they phoned for me, but in the meantime I had gone on the stage again. It broke my heart--to miss that chance. I knew Mack Sennett, Charles West and other prominent movie people. Sennett used to say: 'Come on down, Ruth. I've got a nice part for you.' But I'd say: 'So--let me know when you've got a lead for me. I've never played bits or "suped"--(this was very haughty)--I'll never go into pictures till I can play leads.' "There was a gruff old gentleman, stage manager at the Garrick, then a vaudeville house, named Robert Chandler. He said: 'You know, I'm going to get you a position in movies.' I thought it was the same old promise. "I was going into musical comedy, as soubrette with the Martin Le Roy Co., rehearsing at Long Beach. They wanted me to sign up for 10 weeks, but I had an intuition that I'd better not, so I told them I'd see how I liked it and they liked me for two weeks. "Then I got a phone call. It was Mr. Chandler, to tell me that the Kalem people were starting a new western company and wanted a leading woman. He told me to go to Santa Monica and apply. "I had rehearsed all day at Long Beach. I was tired and dirty and my hair wasn't fixed. I was wearing a Buster Brown suit and collar and a long Kelly-green tie. I like green. I'm a little bit Irish, you know. "I went all the way from Long Beach to Santa Monica that way. I found P. C. Hartigan at his home in his shirt sleeves, and we talked a while in the mellow light of a lamp coming through the curtains from the next room. My green tie--the only clean thing about me--shone like a headlight. "He asked me how much salary I wanted. I was so afraid I'd make a break about the salary that I cut my own salary--$85 in musical comedy--more than in half. I asked if $40 was too much. "'Wait till I see you,' he said, getting another lamp. 'All right. Start Monday.' "I was scared. It made me sick. I was to start Monday in the musical comedy, and I'd already lost one picture position that way. "But I explained the difficulty, and Mr. Hartigan said: 'My wife, Marin Sais, is going to play the lead in the first picture. You can start a week from Monday.' "I was elated, excited despite the $40 salary. But how could I break away, ethically, from my two weeks' engagement? However, Mr. Le Roy very kindly 'refused to stand in my way,' and let me go. I started on Decoration Day. "Mr. Hartigan told me, months later, that that green tie almost lost me my position. 'I'm Irish--H-A-R-T-I-G-A-N--and I thought you wore that green tie just to blarney me,' he said. "I told them I could ride. but not Western style. It was hard work. "I hadn't been on a horse for a year, and I'd only ridden in parks and academies. But the rest of the girls did it, and I wouldn't let 'em think me a 'piker.' It was terrible! It nearly killed me! I'd never ridden like that. "People at that time used to say: 'Oh, I'd never want to work in a 5-cent movie.' But I always had confidence that pictures would come into their own, as they have. "For four years I stayed with Kalem, being featured from the start as 'The Kalem Girl.' There were no stars then. "I was the first and am still the only girl to have a picture made with no one but her in it. This was in 1912--1000 feet of 'Ruth Roland, the Kalem Girl,' showing me riding, swimming, diving, shooting, boxing. It was really sold to show the requirements of a picture actress. "When Kalem changed to western comedy I became a comedienne. Marshall Neilan was my leading man in his first picture, and I was the first one he ever directed. But when they started throwing pies and mud, I didn't think I liked comedy. I went into drama. The comedienne did HEAVY drama! "The minute anyone was starred, Kalem starred me. The first time was in 1914, in a 'serial series,' 'The Girl Detective Series,' each episode complete in itself, showing different cases I solved. It was a natural transition to starring. I've been starring ever since. "NO. I had no influence. Hard work did it--you see I've worked 'all my life.' "At the end of 1914 I went to Pathe, and am still with them, although I'm making my own pictures now for them. I've made seven Gold Rooster features, and this is my eighth serial. "And serials are more popular now than ever! "I've been hurt several times. The worst time was when I was riding a blindfolded horse bareback on top of a mountain, and he ran away when no one was near me. He ran to the edge of a 30-foot precipice. If I'd gone over his head I'd have been killed. So I threw myself off at the side and he ran over me, kicking me and scraping a stick along my leg. "It tore the skin and flesh and muscles, just missing the bone. I was on crutches for three weeks and laid up for five. The doctor said I just missed being laid up for a year." At this moment Ruth, who says she's 25 but looks like any age between that and 18, exclaimed: "I've talked you to death! Aren't you groggy?" But I ask, if you'd been watching a waterfall at dawn, or taking an ice- cold bath in nectar, would YOU feel "groggy"?* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Blanche SweetOctober 31, 1919 Ray W. Frohman LOS ANGELES HERALD Blanche Sweet is a name known everywhere that films are shown--and that means everywhere. But turn it around and the name would be just as appropriate. She is. According to her own modest statement, she got her first moving picture job at 13--because they needed blondes. And she also says that her "previous stage experience helped her to make good." So you can see what an early start she got. She also avers, asservates, avows and articulates that she is a real blonde. Not that anybody every doubted the facts in the case, but she said it and so I'll let her place herself on record. Of course, you've always heard of her as a star of the screen, but she really landed in the show business "feet firsts." She danced with Gertrude Hoffman in New York vaudeville. She "always liked to dance," she testifies. "I don't know just how it happened," she goes on. "I guess I'm like Topsy. Through my good experience on the stage--which doesn't necessarily make people a success in pictures--helped me. What I've acquired I've got through training while working in pictures." That's how the Sweet girl--notice the wording--became a star. She's done so many different things in such a short time that even Blanche can hardly find her way through the interesting story. It's almost as hard to follow her through the maze of her career as it is to find her house. She lives in a pretty home in a pretty section of Hollywood, out--and up--where they have sparrows and beautiful blood-red moons in late afternoon, and flowers on the graveled driveway, and a delightful view of the foothills. I won't tell you exactly where, or how to get there, because I haven't a Baedeker memory--and besides, you haven't been invited to call. Anyhow, here at the end of the labyrinth, in a wicker armchair on her own vinecovered porch, is the beautific and blue-eyed Blanche submitting to a verbal questionnaire for your dear sake, dear reader. Her profile is good to look upon. Her hair is becoming a sort of dull spun gold with the glint of sunshine in it. Her puffs are irreproachable-- not an ear in sight. And her ultramarine eyes are wonderful! She had just come back from the Jess B. Hampton studio, leaving her publicity man, Arthur Statter, far, far away. Her secretary was gone for the day; her maid, Yvonne, was fluctuating to and fro--mostly fro--indoors. Blanche was wearing a black silk pleated skirt, black stockings, black patent leather pumps, a figured blue and white chiffon smock with blue tassels and embroidered white something-or-other that I liked the looks of, but didn't know the name for. She looked young--very young--but she confessed to being 23. She even maintains she has relatives to prove her age. But she complains that the public discusses her longevity thusly: "Blanche Sweet? Yes, I guess that girl can act all right, but she must be OLD AS THE HILLS! Lessee--(business of scratching the head)--it must be seven or eight years ago I saw her and she was playing leads then! MY GOSH, SHE'S NO CHICKEN!" "But they forget," says Blanche, "that I went on the stage very, very young--I've forgotten just how many months old I was. My mother died when I was a year and a half old and I've been on the stage--off and on, you know-- ever since." Her first scene behind the footlights was in one of those good old melodramas, "Blue Jeans," with a famous stock company in Cincinnati. Somebody trotted out a baby for somebody else and the delighted beholder kissed baby's foot. Blanche owned the foot. Thus she became an actress "toot sweet," as it were. Her next appearance was at the ripe old age of 3. Between the yowling age of 4 and the bumptious and fractious age of 9, Blanche played child parts in road shows which would play several weeks in New York. Three of these years she was with Chauncey Olcott. Her father brought her to San Francisco when she was 9 to attend a well known private school for girls. After the great San Francisco fire, they moved to Berkeley. Blanche attended the exclusive Miss Head's school there; but before she finished her course, when she was not quite 13, her grandmother took her to New York to go on the stage. Her's a box score of her peregrinations: When she got to New York she danced with Gerturde Hoffman, famous in Gotham and its environs for artistic scantiness of attire, and novelty, as well as skill in choreographic art, whatever that is. Dancing came naturally to Blanche. Her mother, known to the professional stage by her maiden name of "Pearl Alexander," was a beautiful dancer. Pronto, Blanche went back to Miss Head's. Then, equally pronto, she went back to the stage. No less than three times she went back to Miss Hoffman. Just at this stage in Blanche's grasshopper career, Theodore Kremer produced "Charlotte Temple"--one of that melodramatic type of plays that have six or seven scenes in every act, even if they are bloodless and thunderless. But this is too good--let Blanche tell you. "That, the title role, was a tremendous part for me. It wasn't nerve that may me play it. They tried it on the dog somewhere and said I was too young." Blanche, remember, was still 13. "Yes, I was FIRED." See how honest and frank Blanche is with us? "They sent me back to New York. But they couldn't get anybody else. They tried two or three, and then sent for me again. But I wouldn't go back. I went into pictures. "Why? To make a living, same as anyone else. I heard of them, they were new, and I'd 'try anything once.' "I went to the Edison studio in the Bronx first, for a few weeks--I had one part and was an extra. "Then I went to the Biograph studio in East Fourteenth street to see Frank Powell, thinking there'd be more opportunity for me there. He introduced me to Mr. Griffith and I worked--as and extra--that same afternoon. "I was soon promoted from being an extra, but I could play nothing but young parts. I'd put my hair up 's high as it'd go, and my dresses would drag--but I'd only look like a kid! I got along well there, though--I had 'fat' parts. "They used to 'kid' me out there. Mr. Griffith would look at my blonde hair and turn to Billy Bitzer, his now famous camera man, and say: 'I'm afraid we can't photograph her today--I'm afraid she'll photograph BALD!' As you grow older your hair gets darker, you know. "When Mr. Griffith was going to the Pacific coast for the first time, he wanted me to go. But although he offered me $100 a week--an enormous salary in those days--and I knew I'd only get about $25 a week with Gertrude Hoffman, I went back to her instead. "Then I played the ingenue in a legitimate drama, 'The Turn of the Road.' At the end of its season, I wired Biograph. Mary Pickford had just left them for the Imp Co., and they wanted a blonde for leads. "I'd played ingenue leads in the East, and I've been playing leads ever since I came West at that time; but of course, as everybody knows, they didn't have 'stars' in those days. For a long time they didn't reveal the names of the Biograph players to the public. It was wrong; but there wasn't any one big enough in pictures to MAKE them do it. We played the same kind of plays, and played 'em the same way, but no one was ever featured. "'The Lonedale Operator' was the first picture I played in when I came West to play leads. I was with Mr. Griffith 'till 1913, going on four years." Then Mr. Griffith, taking Blanche and practically the whole studio with him, went to the Reliance Co., releasing through Mutual--he also producing special pictures. Miss Sweet played in the film version of the New York success, "The Escape." After about a year--though Miss Sweet has really done too many different things, as we may have remarked before, to think in terms of "years"--Blanche joined the Lasky forces. In Cecil B. De Mille's "The Warrens of Virginia," which scored a success, Blanche Sweet first really starred in pictures. This was in 1914, we agreed on the porch. You remember, don't you, F. Hopkinson Smith's 'The Tides of Barnegat'? Blanche was the wistful and beautiful blonde hanging over the garden gate when somebody or other left her. For two years she stayed out of pictures. Overwork, which brought on a nervous breakdown, started it; and studio conditions then weren't to her liking, she explained. With Marshall Neilan and others, Miss Sweet formed her own company in 1918, producing her own pictures. this was where she was forced to admit that she played an "emotional" part--in "The Unpardonable Sin"--though she "hates that word." Now, at Hampton's she had filmed a Drury Lane melodrama, "A Woman of Pleasure" and has just finished a comedy-drama, Bret Harte's "Cressy." Neither has yet been released. As Blanche and I both like "Krazy Kat," we were getting along beautifully by this time, so that I can let you in on a few more of Blanche's positive statements about becoming a star--and why she hates being dubbed "emotional." Said she: "Some people just happened to become stars, and some got in at the right time and were lucky. I wonder how many of them have stopped to think how it really came about? "It's so hard--so difficult--so complicated, that it appalls me to think of anyone breaking into the picture game without experience. It doesn't seem complicated to those who are in it, but for anyone else--it would be just like a child trying to get into the University of California without going through the preliminary stages that the high school graduates had! "I'm ambitious to play EVERYTHING on the screen--all types and parts. Of course no one can do everything--the best we can do is to have a high ambition and try and live up to it. "But the trying will be lots of fun--and a great deal of hard work. "Just trying will be worth a lot!"* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Clara Kimball YoungOctober 29, 1919 Ray W. Frohman LOS ANGELES HERALD I didn't even ask Clara Kimball Young how old she is. I do not care. And neither need she. Clara Kimball IS Young. For--no matter whether she is 16 or 60--and I'm sure that she is neither--she is still the most exquisite work of Nature that it has ever been my good fortune to behold. Beauty of face and form, graciousness of manner, engaging smile, sense of humor, wonderful eyes, dazzling teeth, silken tresses--she has them all. And she has a complete working knowledge of how to use them to the very best advantage. Not flirtily, not obtrusively, not even noticeably. But with that completely subtle effect which is altogether bewitching. After which spasm of raving I expect I'd better come down to earth and begin to tell my story. As you may have surmised from the foregoing, it has something to do with Clara Kimball Young. I rhapsodized over Mary Pickford, and rightly. But Mary Pickford is the youth-child, while Clara Kimball Young is the beautiful, mature woman. But entirely aside from her physical charms--and the anomaly of her having a publicity man who is not only not obnoxious but actually is pleasant--Miss Young is delightfully natural, volatile and astoundingly modest. And the story of how she "debutted" into stage life at the rollicking age of THREE and rose to her present rank among the goddesses of the studio-- for she "doesn't consider herself a star"--for that doesn't mean anything now in pictures--is the story of the breaking of precedents by a girl with ideas and a strong will, and of racontree with interesting stage and film folk. "I want to act, too!" gurgled three-year-old Clara, toddling onto the stage during a most pathetic scene in the third act of "Hazel Kirke," being presented in a middle western city by the Mike Bennett company. Bill Burress, playing a character part in the Fine Arts Photoplay feature, "Eyes of Youth," which Miss Young has made as her first release for the Equity Pictures corporation, was a juvenile in that company and remembers her "going on." But let this typical heroine of emotional dramas tell her own story. "No, I didn't break up the show, but everybody laughed. The next night they let me go on in the grocery store scene in 'Peck's Bad Boy' to buy some soap. This appearance, also, was not pre-arranged. "The orchestra struck up a tune and I danced. But they had to drag me off--I didn't know when to quit. "Before that, my parents Edward Marshall Kimball and Pauline Maddern had carried me on as a 'prop.' They were married on the stage, and at 12 months I was on the road. "Then, till I was 9, I played kid parts on tour in a repertoire of old time melodramas. "They were beautiful dramas--'Jim the Penman' and 'Alabama.' I played Little Eva when I was five. (What a Little Eva she must have made!) And I played Willie in 'East Lynne'--and, even as a child, how I hated that play!" After attending public school until she was 14, the beauteous Clara was immured in a convent, St. Francis Xavier's academy, Chicago, until she was16. Then that petulant, "I want to act too" came to the surface again. Her parents were going to join the Aylesworth stock company in a western city--Salt Lake City, I think--and Clara, insisted on going alone. And if you had seen her slap her white cockatoo, "Polly," right on the beak when "Polly" showed signs of wanting to fly away for another 24 hours of vacation in a eucalyptus tree, you'd know that when Clara insists on anything she gets it. "I was very awkward--I was an ugly duckling," said Miss Young regarding this year of playing ingenues and small part. "You made a tremendous hit, if bouquets and having the house sold out count for anything, dearie," amended her mother, who was listening in on our interview. At 18 she played ingenues and ingenue leads with the T. Daniel Frawley stock company in Seattle, which put on such excellent plays as "The Rose of the Rancho," "Peter Pan" (for the first time in stock, and with Miss Young as Wendy, the girl who adopts Peter), and "The Devil," while it was still running in New York. And, wonder of wonders--here's an actress who admits that she once failed to "land" in New York! She explained: "I was never crazy about the stage. I had no definite ambition. It was natural for me to act. There was nothing else for me to do, and my parents saw a future for men on the stage. "When I went to New York at 19, I couldn't get a position. They wanted Broadway names and reputations, and thought stock experience was no good. So after a while I got a vaudeville engagement. Finally I got the part of a young French girl in a musical comedy Henry B. Harris was putting on, 'The Skylark.' The show lasted two weeks!" Her last appearance in spoken drama was at the age of 20, during a 10 weeks' season playing ingenue leads and replacing the leading woman when she was resting, with the Orpheum Stock company in Philadelphia. Percy Winter, brother of the famous dramatic critic, William Winter, was the director. Miss Young played the school teacher, Molly, in "The Virginian," appeared in "Barbara Fretchie," and was in the ingenue in "The Gentleman from Mississippi," with her father joining the company to play the lead, Tom Wise's part. J. Stuart Blackton, one of the owners of the Vitagraph company, saw a photograph of the Clara Kimball Young head, wanted her as she had good stage training and lured her into pictures at $25 a week "with raises right along." And "P. D. Q." two precedents of the then youthful film industry went by the board. Says Miss Young: "It was hard then, eight years ago, to get stage folk into the despised pictures. I was getting $100 a week in stock, but I figured that I'd be employed 52 weeks a year, could live in the same place and wouldn't have to study. "In those days the various characters in various plays all wore company clothes. When they were filming "My Official Wife," the first picture of Russian life, I told Mr. Blackton that, as I was portraying a woman with all kinds of money, I wanted to furnish my own beautiful French ball gowns. "I was the first one to start that (precedent No. 1) and then the others in the company started to get their own things, and they had different clothes in each production. "Was I 'rotten' when I first went into movies? No, I knew how to act. The only thing to learn was how to register before the camera. Mr. Blackton told me just to THINK things inside, and use a consistent improvised conversation, and I'd register things all right. "So, I think theatrical stars make the best picture actors. They need stage experience. It gives them poise, independence, assuredness. "There are exceptions, of course: many stage stars haven't made good in films, and many have made good without stage experience. But Mary Pickford, Fairbanks, Chaplin, Hart, Nazimova, Farrar all had stage experience. I think it's absolutely necessary for picture work. It's being proved right now. We're going right to the stage for our casts; there's not a person in our latest cast who hasn't had stage experience. "Innumerable times I've picked some extra girl with unusual expression from the back row of a group of extras and given her a small part. Ability shows. It's a divine give. "But they don't want to begin small. It seems so easy to act in pictures. But it's not. It's harder work than on the stage--you do more. "On the stage you go from one climax to another, you play the whole show in one evening, you work right through the story and then you're through. "In films I may go into a hallway, for instance, crying. The following situation, the one that I go through the door to arrive at, we may have to put on a week later. I have to go into it cold and yet register the same disposition and the same state of nerves. Then, too, the directors break into dramatic situations and have you finish them another way. "I think you should keep showing action, only interrupting it for the audience with a 'close-up' to show an expression that can't be seen at a distance." For three years, beginning in 1912, "without a contract but looked after like a member of the family," Miss Young played with the Vitagraph stock company, always playing leads. Ralph Ince played opposite her before he ever directed. Incidentally, some of today's big picture stars were extras in the Vitagraph pictures that she played leads in, for, when not working as leads, Vitagraph players used to have to fill in as extras. That's where Miss Young smashed precedent No. 2. Hired for leads, she wouldn't be an extra; the others dittoed, and then they got other people for extras. Vitagraph, Miss Young explained, was the first company to believe in making its players popular, and printed their names in small letters on the lithographs, featuring the whole cast as it were, with the names of John Bunny, Maurice Costello and Florence Turner in larger type. Miss Young played Anne Boleyn in the Henry VIII play, "Cardinal Wolsey"; accompanied the Vitagraph company all around the world for six months in 1913 making short pictures; and was Lady Babbie in its first three-reeler, Barrie's "The Little Minister"--which they were afraid exhibitors would think too long. Finally, in 1914, instead of "Vitagraph presents 'A Million Bid'," it was "Clara Kimball Young" in the electric lights at the Vitagraph theater, New York, in that company's first five-reeler, "My Official Wife." She was the first Vitagraph star to land there, and it was the first time she really starred. And she got $150 a week and quit because they wouldn't give her $200! Can you IMAGINE Clara Kimball Young in slapstick comedies? She had previously done several of them, three reelers, including "Goodness Gracious," with Sidney Drew, a burlesque on "The Perils of Pauline." Then came a contract for starring with the World Film corporation at $200 a week, with provision for advancement to $750. This was for two years. In 1916 she formed her own company to produce famous emotional dramas successful on the stage. In 1917-18 she continued to make her own pictures, releasing through the Select Pictures corporation. One last word from the beautiful star in the patio, with the scarlet geraniums as her background and at a bowl of white and yellow roses at her elbow. An inventory of her personal ornaments revealed: One huge diamond brooch, one large emerald ring set in diamonds, and one diamond-studded watch, but she cried: "Tell them, although my pictures sell well, I'm not making millions!"********************************************************************************************************************************************************** Back issues of Taylorology are available on the Web at any of the following: http://www.angelfire.com/az/Taylorology/ http://www.etext.org/Zines/ASCII/Taylorology/ http://www.uno.edu/~drif/arbuckle/Taylorology/ Full text searches of back issues can be done at http://www.etext.org/Zines/ For more information about Taylor, see WILLIAM DESMOND TAYLOR: A DOSSIER (Scarecrow Press, 1991)*****************************************************************************
