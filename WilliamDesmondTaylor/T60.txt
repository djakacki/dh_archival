The detectives have been watching this mysterious man all day. They would not divulge his name, but said that they were confident that he may have had something to do with the shooting of Taylor. If he tries to leave town, it is said, he will be taken into custody. An expert gunsmith, whose name was not divulged, has offered his services to Captain of Detectives David Adams. He is to take the bullet which was extracted from Taylor's body and by examination tell what kind of gun was used. The inquest will be held at 10 a.m. tomorrow, it was announced late today. The inquest was originally scheduled to be held at 1:30 p.m. Two witnesses, who were questioned today, and said to be very prominent in the motion picture world, declared they saw two men, one of whom answered the description of Edward Sands, loitering about the Taylor home some time before the shooting. The time of the shooting has been placed at between 7:45 p.m. and 8:15. Taylor's chauffeur told the detectives that he tried to call his employer at 8:15 on the night of the murder, and was unable to get him. He said he assumed that the director had stepped out. Detectives today were known to be quietly seeking a young New York broker, whose identity is being kept secret, to question him in an effort to bring to light more facts about the murder. This young man is said to have been prominent in movie society. He is described as a friend of a prominent movie actress. He came from the east, according to the story which detectives are investigating, shortly after the actress returned from a trip to New York, which she made some months ago. Detectives gave no intimation of what light they believed he might possibly shed on the mysterious slaying... Police detectives are concentrating today on the theory that Taylor probably was murdered by a "love killer"--a man who resented Taylor's attention to some woman... A guest in the Dumas home next to Taylor said he saw two men last Monday night in the court yard. The men, the guest said, went to the door of Taylor's home, tried the door with a key, then walked away. One of these men, the police believe, is probably the murderer. Taylor's colored valet, Harry [sic] Peavey, who found the body, said that on several occasions Taylor had been annoyed by mysterious persons walking around his house. He said that on one occasion he asked Taylor why he didn't carry his gun. "Somebody is liable to walk up those stairs when you're in your bedroom," he said he told Taylor, "and hold you up." "No, he won't," Peavey said Taylor replied. "I keep my gun on the bureau, and if I hear anyone walking up those stairs and he doesn't answer when I call him, he's a goner." Peavey said Taylor did drive away these nocturnal visitors on several occasions at the point of a gun.... The newest clues, vague, but showing possibilities of untangling the mystery point to two or more unrequited loves for the murdered man. These women, beautiful, young and prominent, are said to have displayed affections for Taylor, who it is reported did not reciprocate. Tips over the telephone and by letter have come to the police station regarding the mystery slaying. So many angles of this case have developed that it is difficult to find any tangible clue that would lead to the discovery of the assassin....* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 Linton Wells LOS ANGELES RECORD "Never Any Love Affair" So Says Mabel Normand"If I had been engaged to marry Mr. Taylor, I would be only too proud to acknowledge it." In such manner did Miss Mabel Normand, movie star, reiterate to me her denial of any engagement with William D. Taylor, the director, who was murdered Wednesday evening. Tears were in Miss Normand's eyes, her lithe body quivered and shook. She was under a terrible nervous strain. Her voice quavered and broke while she spoke of the dead man. "I had known Mr. Taylor for years," she continued, "ever since I've lived at the Buckingham, but there never was any love affair existing between us--ever!" "I loved Mr. Taylor as a good comrade--a pal with whom I could discuss subjects in which we were both mutually interested. For instance, I had been studying French and Mr. Taylor, who spoke French fluently, helped me tremendously. And, too, I have been somewhat interested in philosophy and metaphysics, and in those subjects he was again an invaluable teacher. "I seldom saw Mr. Taylor, it's true, except at a gathering of friends. But frequently I conversed with him over the telephone. As a general rule merely to ask certain questions regarding the subjects I just mentioned. "Wednesday evening was the first time I ever called upon Mr. Taylor alone. Then I stopped in for a few minutes on my way home in response to a message from Mr. Taylor left with my secretary. The message stated that Mr. Taylor already had sent one book I wanted to the house and had purchased another--one I wanted particularly--and had it at his place. It was for that book that I stopped by. "I arrived about 7 o'clock and left at 7:45. He accompanied me to my car and talked to me a few minutes, laughingly criticizing my literary taste; there was a copy of the Police Gazette in the car and he thought it didn't very well fit in with Freud and Nietsche. "After saying good night and promising to phone me within an hour, I directed William, my chauffeur, to drive me home. Being tired and having a studio call at 7:30 next morning, I retired to my room and within a few minutes I was in bed, where I had dinner served to me. That was about 8:15. Then I dropped off to sleep and slept until Edna Purviance phoned me the following morning the news of Mr. Taylor's death. "Did I know that Mr. Taylor had been married? No. I don't know now that he was. People had told me, but I don't know if it was true. Mr. Taylor never discussed with me his private affairs; there was no reason for his doing so. "I am so terribly shocked over this horrible tragedy I don't know what to do or say. It doesn't seem possible that anyone so lovable--a man who had so many friends and not a known enemy could have been so brutally killed. "My one wish is that the murderer be apprehended and that punishment, however horrible, be meeted out to him."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 Eleanor M. Barnes LOS ANGELES RECORD No, I Wasn't Engaged Star Talks of Slain Man"No, I never was engaged to marry William Desmond Taylor, I regret to say. "No, I was not at his home on the night he was murdered. I was at my home reading a book. "I had seen very little of him since we returned from Europe a year ago. "He didn't have an enemy in the world. "I am positive he was never married, because he would have told me so if he was. "I love little Mabel Normand and I want the whole world to know that I love her, and appreciate her sterling qualities." These were the outstanding statements regarding the mysterious murder of her former director, William Desmond Taylor, made by pretty Mary Miles Minter in an interview at her home last night. Curled up before the fireplace of her quaint adobe home with its soft lights and Spanish furnishings, the lovely blonde star was the center of an interested group of newspaper folk, who wished to employ her aid in solving the murder of the man so brutally slain. Miss Minter has a cold. She was exposed to a cold water bath in the filming of a picture last week, and is recuperating from her experience. But in an attractive dark frock that set off her blonde beauty and with golden hair, she was a pretty picture sitting before the crackling flames. Never in her varied but successful career has the screen star figured in a more interesting story than the one in which her former director lost his life. Miss Minter wants to help clear up the mystery and do all in her power to bring the slayer to justice. "I could use every praiseworthy adjective in the English language to describe him," she said, "and still could not explain to you what a wonderful man he was. "I had never met a man like him. He was loved by everyone who knew him. You just couldn't help trusting him. "And everyone who ever had business dealings with him appreciated his kindness, consideration for others, his generosity. "Just think," the star broke down, "here I was home, reading a book-- enjoying it so much--and he was lying there in his apartment, stone dead. "Oh, I cannot believe that he has been murdered! "Why, I went to his house this morning--mamma and I (pointing to her charming grandmother, Mrs. Mary Miles)--I always call grandma 'mamma' and mother 'mother'--and I couldn't believe he was dead! "I loved him--of course not as--well, you know--but I loved him devotedly. He looked upon me more or less as a child, don't you know. And, although I saw a great deal of him before I went to Europe, after we got back we couldn't drag him away from his work, could we, mother?" the star asked her youthful parent, Mrs. Selby [sic], who smiled indulgently upon her pretty daughter. "No," said Mrs. Selby, "he was more a hard worker. Really, he was more interested in his business than anything else. "Do you know where his ex-wife and daughter are?" Miss Minter was asked. Miss Minter's violet colored eyes flashed fire. "Why he had no wife--he was never married. I'm positive of that!" she replied. "But, maybe Mary, he didn't tell you he was married," broke in Mother. "But mother, I knew him so well--I am sure he wasn't married. I asked him if he was, and he told me no. "I don't think he was interested in women particularly," said the star. "I never was engaged to marry him--no, it wouldn't be fair to say that I was. Of course," she laughed, "every once in a while someone has me engaged to someone--they've had me engaged to eight men this year. "You see he was nearly 50 years old--and although if I loved him and he was 75 I would marry him--but oh, no, there was nothing to that." "Had you heard of a romance between Mabel Normand and Mr. Taylor?" Miss Minter was asked. "No, I hadn't," she said, "but I don't think there was anything to that. If it is true that he had asked to marry her, well I am glad that he and Mabel were such good friends. Mabel is a lovely girl. She is frank--if she wants to do anything she does it--that's why I admire Mabel. "And she is big-hearted and noble of character. I love Mabel Normand." "When did you see Mr. Taylor last?" the actress was asked. "Let's see," she pondered. "I hadn't seen dear old Mr. Taylor since before Christmas. In fact, I hadn't seen him in a year. Oh, yes, we passed him on the boulevard yesterday --just think, it was a few hours before he was murdered." Miss Minter was almost in tears. "Have they found his former valet?" she asked suddenly. She intimated that she believed Edward F. Sands was the villain, but she said: "It would be unfair to accuse anyone of the crime. Maybe a crank or some demented person committed it. Did you see 'The Bat' at the Mason? There is a mystery story that would thrill you. You would sit on the edge of the seat while it is showing. I saw it in New York."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 LOS ANGELES RECORD Hot Murder Clue Proves a FizzleAnother tip in connection with the Taylor murder mystery "blew up" at noon today. It was the clue that Edward Sands, former secretary and valet for the murdered man, was being held at the city jail. Upon investigation it was found that a Sands was in jail, but that his name is Edward W. Sands. He was arrested for petty larceny at a downtown department store and sentenced to serve 30 days in the city jail. Sands was given probation several years ago by Judge Craig after his conviction on a charge of grand larceny in connection with the alleged theft of automobile tires. He is now held at the county jail pending a hearing in Judge Reeve's court for violation of parole.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 OAKLAND POST-DISPATCH William D. Taylor, whose murder at Hollywood has shaken the screen world to almost as great an extent as the trial of Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle, was an Oakland visitor two years ago. Taylor and Mary Miles Minter, whom he was directing, came here at that time for Realart. Both the screen star and her director were guests of the Ad Club at that time. Miss Minter made two appearances at a local theater. The director's interest in Miss Minter was that of a father. He watched her movements, refused to allow her to walk from the Hotel Oakland entrance to a waiting automobile until the rain had subsided; guarded her against admirers when she was obliged to force her way through a crowded theater lobby and once, when they were seated and witnessing one of Miss Minter's own pictures, refused to allow other members of the party to disturb her with questions.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 LOS ANGELES RECORD Valet in Court on Vagrancy ChargeHenry Peavey, 40, of 127 1/2 East Third street, who found the body of William D. Taylor, famous motion picture director, found murdered in his home at 404B South Alvarado street, was scheduled to go to police court yesterday afternoon to face a charge of social vagrancy. Peavey, according to Patrolman S. G. White, was arrested, charged with being lewd and dissolute in Westlake park a few hours before his employer was murdered. Taylor, it is said, bailed the negro out. His case was taken off the calendar after Taylor's death. No date was set for the trial.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 SAN FRANCISCO CALL Los Angeles--...The seven detectives who are most actively engaged in hunting the murderer told the International News Service it is one of the most baffling cases in the annals of the local police department. It was stated that a complete probe will be made of Taylor's past life in an effort to get behind the veil of mystery surrounding the case and bring the slayer to justice. "Wherever the trail leads, there will be detectives to follow," said one police official. "There will be no whitewashing of any person or any group of persons." One of the foremost moving picture actresses was scheduled to be questioned late today regarding her asserted love for Taylor. While no suspicion rests on the woman, the police say, she may be able to throw a direct ray of light on some asserted love tangle in which Taylor may have been a principal. Among the various phases of the investigation was a report that Taylor had attended several so-called "snow" parties, at which narcotics were served from tea wagons, for the purpose of obtaining local color for some of his pictures. The slaying, one detective pointed out, may have been an aftermath of such a party. Weird narratives of a mystic love cult also entered into the investigation when reports to the police linked Taylor's name with the strange life of the cult leaders. The weird love which was said to have existed as a part of the cult may have inspired one of the members to have caused Taylor's death, according to another detective who spent considerable time in delving into the mysticisms and entanglements of the asserted coterie... One of Taylor's closest friends, and a former business associate, told the International News Service this afternoon that he has arrived at the conclusion the director was killed at the instigation of a woman. "I have been in touch with the police for 24 hours," said this man, "and I know the theories on which they have been working. They have now arrived at the belief he was murdered in a vengeance plot. "I know Taylor was very friendly with one woman screen star. He gave her a farewell party last summer before he went to Europe. He took her to the Writers' Cramp, a notable entertainment recently given for the celebrities of 'movie' colony. "The director and I had many conversations of a personal nature. But he was more or less of a man of mystery. I do not know that he had been friendly in recent months with any woman other than the screen actress, but it seems likely to me that a man of his engaging personality and magnetic charm should have attracted a number of women. "Since I am positive that he had no business enemies, I am inclined to believe a woman's hand was at the bottom of it all and that the man who fired the shot was paid to do it."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 LONG BEACH TELEGRAM ...The detectives sent into Hollywood to run down the slayer of Taylor were instructed to overlook no whisper of gossip that might bring the answer to the riddle of death. They were told to inquire especially, it was stated, about a recent "party" where dope, ether, cocaine and morphine took the place of wine and whisky. The party ended in a savage brawl, it was declared, in which two infuriated women attacked each other and fought as men fight until their clothes were ripped off. Both of them, the report insists, were prominent actresses, whose names are known to the police. They were to be questioned during the day.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 LOS ANGELES HERALD ...Police said today that the arrest of a mystery man seen loitering in the vicinity of the Taylor residence about the time of the murder was believed near. This man, seen by many persons, was suspected of having killed Taylor because of jealousy. It was believed that the man under suspicion was intimate with some woman friend of the slain director...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 Wallace Smith WISCONSIN NEWS Los Angeles--...Three main theories were built by the police: 1--That Taylor was slain by a jealous woman or one whom he had enraged. 2--That a cast-off lover of some woman with whom Taylor had been friendly had sought this means of revenge. 3--That a hired assassin made his way into the Taylor home as Taylor took Miss Normand to her automobile. It was on these theories broadly that the police were working. Armed with them, they took up the murderer's trail in the gay set of the moving picture world--the fast clique whose "secret" orgies and debaucheries are scarcely secret. Taylor was popular and, the police declare, it would have been almost impossible for him to avoid these wild "parties" even if he took no part in the mad dissipations and excesses. In fact, it was reported that he had escorted several women to these affairs.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXPRESSTwo Film Actresses and Two Men are Linked with Taylor Murder by PoliceThe names of two young film actresses and a man who has so far not figured in the case were linked by the police today in their investigation into the slaying of William Desmond Taylor, noted film director. The names of these persons are for the time being withheld by the police. The man, however, is known to have had a bitter quarrel with Taylor within the last month. He is under surveillance. Another man, who has already been questioned by the police, is also being watched and may again be quizzed before dawn tomorrow. The police are convinced that he has not told all he may know of circumstances surrounding the case. These facts are the outstanding ones today in the now famous murder mystery, known in police circles as the Taylor murder. It is calling forth the best efforts of seven detective sergeants, and many plainclothes officers. Subpenas for more than a half score of film stars and men prominent in the motion picture industry were served by police detectives today for the inquest at 1:30 o'clock tomorrow afternoon over the body of Taylor. Among those who will testify will be Mary Miles Minter, Douglas MacLean, Mabel Normand, Edna Purviance, Charles Eyton, Mrs. Douglas MacLean and Mrs. Julia Crawford Ivers. The inquest will be conducted by Coroner Nance and his chief assistant, William McDonald, in the mortuary of the Ivy H. Overholtzer undertaking establishment. Directly after Detective Sergeants Ziegler and Walls had left with the subpenas, Detective Sergeants Wood, Murphy, Herman Cline, Winn, Cato and Cahill left for separate places to run down clues that had been sent to Detective Capt. Dave Adams within the last 12 hours. These officers were to meet late today to report to Captain Adams the results of their quests. In the meantime it is known that two of the officers were questioning closely Taylor's chauffeur, in an effort to learn the places he had taken the film director during the last few weeks that might reveal some clew as to the identity of possible enemies... One important fact was brought out by Detective Sergeant Herman Cline, opening up theories of possible robbery as motive. It was known to several friends that on Wednesday Taylor had in his possession in gold and currency $2300. He had intended putting this money in the bank the following day, but for some unknown reason he visited the bank late Wednesday and deposited the money. It is the belief of Sergeant Cline that if robbery was the motive the burglar after firing the shot became frightened that the noise might have aroused some persons in the neighborhood, and fled without attempting to steal anything... Several things have been discovered in Taylor's past, the officers say, that may assist in solving the mystery. The police today were close on the trail of a man who three hours before the murder made inquiries in the neighborhood as to the location of Taylor's home... Taylor was a man who possessed great nerve and coolness under any circumstances. Friends say he probably would have refused to obey the order of a burglar to hold up his hands. Such being the case, it is possible according to the robbery theory that the burglar fired the one shot that ended the man's life... An investigation was also put under way to determine whether or not the mysterious telephone calls frequently received by Taylor might lead to the identity of the murderer. The director, his friends say, often told of the calls in the night. When he answered there was no answer, it is said. This phase of the situation, however, the police believe, indicates that some one laid careful plans for the murder of the director and had long borne a grudge against him...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 3, 1922 LONG BEACH PRESS Normand Called as Witness Love Rival Shot Film Genius"Some one will be under arrest before nightfall, charged with the murder of William D. Taylor." This was the positive assertion here today of Detective Captain David L. Adams, directing a corps of operatives attempting to solve the murder mystery which has almost completely paralyzed the movie world. It was rumored throughout Hollywood today that police had established jealousy as the motive for the murder of the veteran director, and were looking for a man said to have expressed a deep-rooted hatred for Mr. Taylor because of the latter's attentions to a woman... The "wanted" man is said to have invaded Taylor's beautiful bungalow at Westlake Terrace Court on several occasions, and to have been driven away each time at the point of a revolver... Thursday morning the Terraces were awakened by the cries of Mr. Taylor's colored man, Henry Peazy [sic]. Mr. and Mrs. MacLean, Miss Edna Purviance of the Chaplin studios and others rushed into the Taylor bungalow and found its owner stretched on the floor dead, with a bullet through his back. He had been seated at a desk, facing a picture of Miss Normand, when an assassin shot him from behind. On a nearby tabouret was found glasses and a decanter containing gin and orange juice. The fact that more than one of the glasses contained a bit of orange juice in the bottom showed that Taylor had not been drinking by himself. Newspapermen unearthed more liquor upstairs in Taylor's home, before it was hurriedly removed by his friends...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 LONDON TIMES Feb. 3--...What the police regard as an important clue was discovered this afternoon. Detectives are investigating "a dope party" given at Hollywood recently, at which cocaine and other drugs were served instead of drinks. Two women, both film actresses, stated that they quarreled over Taylor and fought, ripping the clothes from each other's bodies. Taylor was not present at the party. The police theory is that Taylor's murder was contrived by one of the women, to whose advances he had refused to respond...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Woman Star New Focus in Taylor Death Case Investigation of Murder Swings to Actress and Director, While Ex-Secretary is HuntedA motion picture actress whose name has thus far not been mentioned in connection with the murder of William Desmond Taylor, famous film director, late last night was the center of investigation of the combined forces of detectives detailed to solve the mystery of the slaying. Mr. Taylor was shot to death within a few minutes after Mabel Normand left his home last Wednesday night. For almost four hours the detectives closely questioned former employees of Mr. Taylor in an endeavor to check details of their new theory of the crime, which, they still believe, was inspired by a revenge motive with jealousy as the probable cause. Throughout the long questioning, which was conducted in the Detective Bureau of Central Police Station, every attempt was made to find out all facts regarding the past life and recent movements of Mr. Taylor. His friendship with such prominent motion-picture stars as Mabel Normand, Mary Miles Minter and Claire Windsor was discussed in detail. Many new features of his life were disclosed during the examination of these former employees. With the motion-picture actress mentioned last night the name of a director also was linked. The officers believe these two persons may be able to aid materially in clearing up the case. Throughout this investigation, however, efforts of the detectives were also directed toward finding Edward F. sands, former secretary and who was made defendant in a complaint in which Mr. Taylor charged him with forgery. Sands was in Los Angeles, the police believe, both on the day of the shooting and also the day before. Another witness saw him several days before the crime, they say. From Mrs. Earl Tiffany, wife of a former chauffeur of Mr. Taylor, it was learned she saw Sands last Tuesday, the day before the shooting. This meeting was in another part of the city, far removed from 404-B South Alvarado street, where Mr. Taylor, shot in the back, was found Thursday morning. Another witness is said to have seen Sands on South Alvarado street the night of the murder. These clews have caused the investigators to redouble their efforts to find the former employee, because they believe he can throw valuable light on the life of Mr. Taylor. Earl Tiffany, who was chauffeur for Mr. Taylor until a short time after Tiffany says he told Mr. Taylor he believed he would keep a record of the trips on which he took him, also was questioned. Mr. Tiffany added many clews to the few already in the possession of the detectives. He related in detail, as he remembered the incidents, many supposed facts concerning Mr. Taylor's friendship for Mary Miles Minter, film star whom he formerly directed, then for Mabel Normand, also an actress, and before either of them another woman whose activities are now being investigated by the police. After Mr. Tiffany was questioned, Harry Fellows, assistant director for Mr. Taylor and brother of Howard Fellows, Mr. Taylor's last chauffeur, was taken to the room with the detectives. He was closeted for a long time. In the meanwhile his wife and sister-in-law waited impatiently outside for him. Mr. Fellows is understood to have told the officers he could remember few details that might aid them. He formerly was chauffeur fro Mr. Taylor, but is asserted to have declared he could not recall the names of some of the persons about whom the detectives wanted to know. Mr. Tiffany was chauffeur for Mr. Taylor until last July. He had considerable experience as a chauffeur for another prominent motion-picture man during an exciting night just preceding an action for divorce filed by the latter's wife. Because of this experience, Mr. Tiffany says, he remarked to Mr. Taylor one day that he believed he would keep a diary on the trips he made so that he could know just where he went every day and would have record of it. Mr. Taylor said nothing, Mr. Tiffany says, but in a fortnight told Mr. Tiffany he would not require his services longer. Mr. and Mrs. Tiffany, both of whom know Sands personally and are familiar with his habits and opinions, believe he will be able to throw little light on the case except inasmuch as Mr. Taylor's past life may aid in solving the mystery. In telling of the incidents in Mr. Taylor's life which he observed, Mr. Tiffany said Mary Miles Minter formerly was a favored friend of Mr. Taylor. No other girl appeared to enter into Mr. Taylor's attentions. Later, a change came about, according to Mr. Tiffany, and on occasions when Miss Minter called at the Taylor house, Sands told her Mr. Taylor was not at home, when in fact, he was. About this time Mabel Normand came in for more and more attention from Mr. Taylor, the chauffeur's story continues. She was still the ruling favorite among the friends of Mr. Taylor, when Mr. Tiffany left his employ. In connection with this fact, Henry Peavey, negro houseman of the slain man, and who was questioned by the police again yesterday, said Mr. Taylor told him that if Miss Normand telephoned between 5 and 6 o'clock on the night of the slaying he was home, but if anyone else called he was not. Detective Sergeants Herman Cline, Winn, Murphy, Cato and Cahill, were active in the further questioning that took place last night... The name of Claire Windsor, motion-picture star who once was reported engaged to Charlie Chaplin, was thrust into the investigation when it was learned that she had been out riding and to a dinner with Mr. Taylor a week or so before the murder. It was the first time she had ever been out with him, her mother stated yesterday. The officers expressed a wish to ascertain whether she knew of any possible enemies, but Miss Windsor could not be located. The Coroner's inquest will be held this morning at 10 o'clock at the Ivy Overholtzer undertaking establishment. Several film celebrities have been subpoenaed to appear at the inquest. Mabel Normand, film actress, again was questioned by the police. No additional information was obtained, it was stated. Miss Normand relating again that she left Mr. Taylor's flat about 7:45 or 7:50 o'clock on the night of the murder and that Mr. Taylor accompanied her to her automobile. In this she was corroborated by her negro [sic] chauffeur, William Davis, also subpoenaed for the inquest. Mr. Taylor was shot, the police believe, within a very few minutes after Miss Normand left. The District Attorney's office swung into action in the case when a survey of the premises was made under the direction of Chief Dep. Dist.-Atty. Doran. Investigators from that office also were working on the mystery. Information was sought from Mary Miles Minter, a film-actress friend, who rushed to the house, becoming almost hysterical when she confirmed the report she had received Thursday morning that Mr. Taylor was murdered. Little information of value was obtained from her. The efforts to locate Miss Windsor yesterday assumed a peculiar turn. At her home her mother stated Miss Windsor was out on location with Marshall Neilan. At the studios of Mr. Neilan it was stated he was on location, but that Miss Windsor was not. Her mother said Miss Windsor had been with Mr. Taylor recently, but that for the last week has been very busy on location, being compelled to work late at night and into the early morning. For this reason she has been sleeping at the studio, and had not been home except at rare intervals, she stated. Charles Maigne, director at the Lasky studio, was closeted for more than an hour yesterday afternoon with Captain of Detectives Moffatt. The nature of the conference was not divulged. The motion-picture colony yesterday continued to seethe with the mystery of how and why Mr. Taylor, one of the leading figures in the industry, was murdered. Many rumors and reports connecting names of film stars in a way tending to show they may know something of the motives of the slayer were received during the day by the investigators...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Celebrities to be Witnesses Taylor Inquest is Set for This MorningWitnesses at the inquest will include many nationally known persons who have been interviewed by police detectives concerning their knowledge of the crime. Those subpoenaed yesterday by Detective Sergt. Jack Wallis include the following: Mabel Normand, one of the best-known comediennes in the motion-picture profession and who was the last known person to have seen and talked with Mr. Taylor before his death. She had visited his home to get a book he had purchased for her and left his apartment only a few minutes before the time of his murder. Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of a widely known motion-picture star, whose front door is only a few paces from Mr. Taylor's apartment. Mrs. MacLean, upon hearing a shot, opened her door, looked out and saw a man leaving the Taylor apartments. She is the only person who has given the investigators an unquestioned first-hand description of the slayer. Charles Eyton, general manager of the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, and the fourth husband of Kathlyn Williams, also a motion-picture star. Mr. Eyton, a personal friend of the slain man, was one of the first persons to arrive at the Taylor apartments and conducted an inventory of the murdered man's property. Verne Dumas, wealthy oil man, who also was one of the first neighbors to enter the apartment. William Davis, Miss Normand's chauffeur, who drove her to Mr. Taylor's home. His story corroborates that of his employer. Henry Peavey, colored servant employed by Mr. Taylor, who first discovered the body and who will relate incidents pertaining to the finding of the body. Howard Fellows, chauffeur for Mr. Taylor, who is expected to corroborate the time of the murder. Mr. Fellows visited the Taylor apartment at 8 p.m. on the night of the crime and though the home was lighted in all rooms he received no response at the door. He later called his employer on the telephone but failed to arouse anybody. E. J. Jessrund [sic], owner of the apartment occupied by Mr. Taylor and a neighbor who was one of the first to respond to Peavey's cries of "murder." Autopsy Surgeon Wagner, who will relate his findings in diagnosing the cause of Mr. Taylor's death.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Suspect Taylor Feared DeathDid William D. Taylor, murdered film director of nation-wide fame, fear the fate in store for him and take every precaution the last few days of his life to surround his movements and whereabouts with utmost secrecy? This was the question asked yesterday by the investigators in their effort to reconstruct the circumstances that led to the slaying of the famous director in his palatial flat on Alvarado street last Wednesday night. A clew that led the officers to believe Taylor was uneasy about something in the days immediately preceding the shooting, was given to Detective Sergeants Cline, Murphy, Winn and Ziegler, yesterday, by Henry Peavey, colored porter and housekeeper for Taylor. Peavey was taken to the detective bureau of Central Police Station yesterday afternoon and there questioned by the officers on the case. His examination followed that of Howard Fellows, chauffeur for Mr. Taylor, and from information obtained by the officers from the two men, who knew intimate details of the slain film man's life, the officers obtained important tips. The most significant part of the new statement made by Peavey yesterday was that Taylor left the house on a mysterious call Wednesday afternoon, leaving the automobile behind. "Mr. Taylor left the house about 5 o'clock, saying he wanted to walk, and leaving strict orders not to answer any telephone inquiries to the house with one exception," said Peavey. "He said that if Miss Normand called to tell her he would be back after 6 o'clock, but instructed me to tell everyone else he was out and that I did not know where he was or when he would be back." From the few papers and documents obtained by them at the Taylor flat, the officers working on the case yesterday sought to glean, if possible, some clew as to where Taylor went when he left the house Wednesday afternoon. Names and addresses, recorded by Mr. Taylor, of a number of well-known persons in the film world and in business circles here are in the possession of the police, and a thorough check of these will be made in an effort to trace accurately and completely every movement of the slain film director on the days before his murder.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Hunt for Luxurious CarWhat may prove to be an important clew in the hunt for the murderer of William D. Taylor was placed before the police last night in a report that a large automobile of striking appearance was seen in the vicinity of the Taylor home the night of the slaying. This automobile, according to the reports to the police, was an expensive car painted a chocolate-brown shade. The automobile, according to the reports, was seen to drive up to the Taylor home late in the afternoon and remain there for some time. It left the corner of Alvarado and Maryland streets a few minutes after the automobile of Miss Mabel Normand drove up. A peculiar part of this episode is a conflicting report from another source that an automobile described as a closed car, dark green in color, was the vehicle in question. The time and location given in the two reports check in every detail, but the make of car and color of the bodies are different. "We are going to check every possible angle of this case," Detective Sergeant Herman Cline said yesterday. "There are a great many conflicting reports given us and for the first few days it is a large task to distinguish the important from what has no connection with the case. If we can verify certain facts laid before us in connection with this murder, then the description of these two cars will become very important." This is the only comment the officers on the case would make on this phase of the investigation. The importance of the clew about the automobile described is that the police believe they may be able to trace the owners and from them learn either of visits to Mr. Taylor's apartment or about persons seen loitering in the vicinity of the place.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Taylor Home is Mapped District Attorney Swings into Action in Death Case Many Theories EntertainedThe District Attorney's office swung into action yesterday in an attempt to solve the mystery of the murder of William Desmond Taylor and also to lay a foundation for future prosecution in the event the slayer is captured. At the same time the police searched Mr. Taylor's apartments at 404-B South Alvarado street, and took charge of letters, papers and documents that might serve to thrown some light on the slain film director's affairs. Chief Dep. Dist.-Atty. Doran and Investigator Contreras made a thorough search of the apartments, and canvass of the vicinity. Albert E. Timmons of the County Surveyor's office and two assistants, P. W. Atkins and R. B. Heuer, drew plans of each room and the territory contiguous to the residence. Detective Sergeants Herman W. Cline, Winn and Murphy, represented the police department in the search of the premises. Papers belonging to Mr. Taylor were taken to Central Police Station and carefully examined. The arrangement of the furniture in the room where the fatal shot was fired was not disturbed, as the officers stated a careful scrutiny would be made for possible finger prints. This phase of the investigation applies particularly in the chair in which Mr. Taylor was possibly sitting when shot, and which was found turned over across his legs. Mr. Taylor's apartments were tastefully furnished. There were books in profusion, mostly of a philosophical and sociological trend, numerous photographs of persons in the motion-picture colony, relics of the war, and much art work and bric-a-brac. The police yesterday questioned four persons found by The Times who had seen a man believed to be the slayer go to the Taylor residence before the shooting and leave the vicinity a few minutes after the bullet had been fired. The time of the murder has been fixed by police at between 7:49 and 8:15 p.m. Wednesday. L. A. Grant and Floyd Hartley, service station men, at Sixth and Alvarado streets, stated that a man had inquired of them where W. D. Taylor lived shortly before 6 o'clock. They directed him to the Alvarado street address, and he left. The description of this man corresponds with that of a man who boarded an inbound West First-street car at the Maryland-avenue stop, at either 7:54 or 8:25 p.m. Motorman R. S. Woodward and Conductor E. W. Dascomb took notice of the passenger because it was the first stop they had made on Maryland street for months. The man was described by these four persons as about five feet and nine or ten inches tall, 26 or 27 years old and weighing between 155 and 165 pounds. He had dark hair and wore a dark suit and either a light hat or cap. ...Floyd Hartley yesterday was unable to identify a picture of Sands as the man who inquired at the oil station. He was inclined to think they were different individuals, but was not positive. While the revenge and jealousy theories appear to be the most plausible thus far in the investigation the police are not overlooking the possibility of a blackmail angle. This factor is being probed by detectives detailed to the case. It is considered possible that the slayer attempted to extort money from Mr. Taylor and when refused or threatened with arrest, he shot to kill. An open checkbook on Mr. Taylor's writing desk and a pen with fresh ink on it might be considered part of a ruse by Mr. Taylor to "stall off" the murderer until the police could be advised. The story that a woman is involved in the slaying--supplying the motive of jealousy--is seriously entertained by the police. Although the slain man led a fairly studious life it is known that he had a wide circle of women acquaintances and that some of them were visitors to his home. An enraged suitor who had been discarded might very easily have carried out this plan, it is believed, to eliminate Mr. Taylor as a rival. In order to ferret out a revenge motive, for some real or fancied wrong, the police say they will have to trace back the incidents in Mr. Taylor's life. He led a varied and exciting career that took him to many out-of-the- way places of the globe. Investigators feel confident that he must have incurred some bitter enmity during his activities and travels.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Girl's Devotion to Father EvidencedMute evidence of the tender affection which existed between Ethel Daisy Taylor, 14-year-old daughter of the slain film director, William Desmond Taylor, and her father, was found by The Examiner yesterday. Inscribed on a page and a half of note paper, written in typical school girl chatter, it bears every evidence of the strong devotion that undoubtedly existed. Postmark Mamaroneck, N. Y., and dated February 6, 1921, the letter reads: "Dear Father of Mine: "Excuse the weird paper, but I am having some made and haven't gotten it as yet. I like your paper very much and am always glad when I hear from you. "I have read your letters over ever and ever so many times until I almost know them by heart. I would have answered sooner, only I have had a siege of infected fingers. Three, one right after the other, and have only just gotten through with them. "Of course, that made it rather difficult to write or draw, so I stayed home a couple of the days. I had one of the fingers cut four times, but the others only once. "Mercy goodness, I wish you didn't have to work so long. You'll wear yourself down again, so be careful, won't you, Papa, pettie dear? Will the picture with Miss Compson be interesting? I do wish I might see you soon. I think of you so much it seems as if I saw you much more often than every once in a while. "I realize how seldom we really see each other and I surely do hope you'll be East again soon, dear. I'd like very much to send you some real nice things for Christmas, but haven't the least idea what you would like, so kindly tell me, please, dear. "I must stop now. Oh, Father, dear, I do love you so much. "Ethel."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER The names of two film actresses were injected last night into the investigation of the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery. One is a star of national reputation. The other is a girl of humbler station in motion picture ranks. While detectives working on the case refused to confirm the above mentioned facts it was learned from other sources that investigation had disclosed a close association between Taylor and these two screen actresses. Of almost equal interest in the development of the investigation was the statement of Mrs. Earl Tiffany, wife of Taylor's chauffeur, that she saw Edward F. Sands, ex-secretary-valet of the murdered director, now sought as a witness, at Sixth and Figueroa Streets Tuesday afternoon last [the day prior to the murder] at 1:20 o'clock. Mr. and Mrs. Tiffany were subjected to a long examination last night, during which she revealed what the investigators [regard] as one of the most important clews yet to come before them. In regard to the screen actresses, the police refused to make any mention of their names or to discuss what part they are alleged to have played in the mystery. Until a late hour last night police detectives questioned Harry Fellows, Taylor's assistant director. They are said to regard Fellows as one of the vital witnesses in the case because of his close contact with Taylor for many months. The questioning last night, they said, was for the purpose of checking over Taylor's movements for three days preceding his murder. The search for Sands continued with unabated intensity. He is said to have returned to Los Angeles Tuesday and uttered this threat: "I am here to get Bill Taylor." His intimate knowledge of Taylor's double identity was revealed in startling fashion late yesterday when in Fresno it was learned that Sands had there pawned jewelry stolen from Taylor and that he had given the name "William Deane-Tanner," asserted to be Taylor's true name. The jewelry upon which a loan had been made and a ticket issued consisted of a pair of cuff links set with diamonds and onyx shirt studs, also set with diamonds. The man who secured the loan answered the description of Sands. In a bold hand he wrote on the ticket retained by the broker the name of his one-time employer, "William Deane Tanner." The meaning of this might have remained impenetrable, something as deep as the shadows as all else that concerns the silent figure whose tragic end left the motion picture world aghast and stunned. But by some means, possibly by reading his mail, it is believed, and learning the details of the allowances sent to his daughter, Sands became possessed of the secret. It may be said, parenthetically, that no member of the picture colony believes the change in name was for any purpose of concealment. Taylor (and that name will be used as most accurate) said not long ago to a friend, "I have known great sadness in my life." It is believed that the "Tanner" was discarded along with the old life which he had described as being so unhappy. The police are assured beyond peradventure that the man who pawned the jewelry in Fresno, using the true name of the owner in a spirit of malicious triumph, was Edward Sands. There is something in this very circumstance which to the officers is itself a flood of light coming out of the darkness. The stealing and forgery indulged in by Sands did not convey the spirit of this piece of treachery; they might have been only for gain. But now that the Fresno episode is brought up from the obscurity of a dark little hole-in- the-wall pawn shop to be made plain in all its details, a new element appears. This new element is the pronounced unfriendliness of Sands, which takes on the aspect of a sinister and silent threat. The malice is further revealed in what seems to have been a persistent campaign of Sands to annoy the director. From Fresno he sent him a pawn ticket, a ticket issued on valuables stolen from Taylor on which money had been raised. Still another pawn ticket came through the mail from Sacramento. With this was the letter signed "Alias Jimmy V." These were derisive thrusts at Taylor; from some motive which has not been revealed the thief and forger was trying to torture the victim of his crimes. Chief of Police Frank Truex of Fresno, who found the pawned jewelry, learned that other articles stolen from Taylor and not recovered were pledged in Sacramento. It was disclosed yesterday that Mabel Normand recently made Taylor a present of a black amber cigarette holder valued at $1800. This is said to be one of the finest things of its kind ever made. In return Taylor gave Miss Normand a dresser set costing $1200. ..."We are satisfied that we have everything checked up to 8 o'clock on the night of the murder. "The man who killed William D. Taylor is the one who was seen leaving his apartment shortly before that time Wednesday night. This is our absolute conclusion. "We also have a definite clew as to who the man is and his motive. But to reveal either, would be to prevent clear and straightaway police work upon our hypothesis." This was the statement last night of Captain of Detectives David L. Adams, after receiving reports from his staff of detectives who yesterday were combing through a multitude of rumors for something substantial. Sands, whose true name, The Examiner yesterday learned, is Edward Fitz Strathmore, wanted for desertion from the Army as well as for the robberies committed against Taylor, was seen in Los Angeles Tuesday. Hunted as a fugitive by both Federal and State officers, he nevertheless ran the gauntlet, appearing, it is said, without attempt at concealment either of his person or his plan. It is the latter which particularly interests the police. To a man who has given a detailed report of the conversation Sands is said to have threatened, with a curse, "I'm here to get Bill Taylor." Included among the persons who saw Sands on Tuesday are women whose testimony will probably be of the utmost importance if he is apprehended. One of these is said to have seen him Wednesday night near the scene of the crime. Her identity is being kept secret. There are so many fingers pointing at this man that the police have centered their efforts upon finding him. With the little light as to the relations between Taylor and Sands it is admittedly difficult to reconstruct the tragedy upon the basis merely of the discharged man's enmity growing out of Taylor's felony complaint against him. Hence, as a working theory, it is presumed that there may have been a much deeper motive underlying the act. That Taylor was not shot in the back, as at first reported, but in the left side, was yesterday discovered by Detectives Cato and Cahill, who minutely examined the wound. The single bullet entered at a point where the left elbow would rest if the arm were held naturally at the side. It might seem, therefore, that Taylor, hearing a noise in his room, turned from his writing desk where he was going over the stubs of his check book, and was shot on the moment he discovered the intruder. ...There is, however, a great mass of material upon which the police are checking, hoping that from the pile of chaff there may be found the single grain of information which, it is hoped, may germinate into the full disclosure of the dastardly act and all of its ramifications. Theodore Kosloff, the dancer, contributed one of these stories. Some two weeks ago he was with Taylor "on location," a place in the country. They were walking together. Suddenly from behind a clump of brush a man arose almost with a spring. Quicker than this surprising stranger, said Kosloff, was Taylor. He leaped around to one side and faced the man. They stood eye to eye for a moment, neither speaking. Then the man turned and walked away. Taylor, vouchsafing no explanation, continued the interrupted conversation. This unaccountable happening came to Mr. Kosloff's mind yesterday when he learned of his friend's violent end. But aside from relating the peculiar circumstances he could add nothing. ...Something of the description of this man was learned yesterday by The Examiner from A. A. Tomlinson, an accountant of 1022 West Fortieth Place. "The true name of this man," said Tomlinson, "is not Sands but Strathmore. I recognized him by his picture in this morning's Examiner. "He enlisted in the army during the war as Edward Fitz Strathmore and was assigned to Columbus Barracks, Ohio. I was then head of the finance office and upon learning that Strathmore had been a chief petty officer in the navy I asked that he be transferred to my department, which was done. "On October 4, 1919, Strathmore forged my name to a Government check for $475 and tried to buy a motorcycle with it. He failed to carry out this scheme, but escaped. At the same time he forged the commanding officer's name to a discharge. He has been wanted for desertion. "On July 4, 1920, I met him on Alvarado Street. He told me that he was expecting to get work with the street car company. I notified the police, but he disappeared. "During his service with me at Columbus Barracks, Strathmore often boasted of the crimes he had committed. I did not believe him then, but thought it was a case of a young fellow drawing on his imagination. "Once I asked him what he would do if he were in a dangerous situation. He said he would shoot his way out. "Strathmore gave me a number of books, all bearing his signature on the inside of the cover. In each case the 'Strathmore' was written over a name which had been erased. In one of them I was able to make out that the erased name was 'Sands.' "Among the volumes is one bearing, in Strathmore's handwriting, the entry, 'c-o Perry P. Le Berthon, 982 Fifty-second street, Brooklyn, N. Y." The Examiner wired to Columbus barracks for a description of Strathmore and received the following: "Dark complexion, ruddy face, height 5 feet 5 3/4 inches, slightly bow- legged." Strathmore, or Sands, is a constant cigarette smoker. ...Recently, it was learned, Taylor had attended two or three "hop" parties where all but he had either smoked opium or taken a drug in some form. He was there, it was assumed, to get "atmosphere" for a picture. The possibility that the beginning of the tragedy had its setting at one of these proscribed affairs is being considered. ...The many friends of Taylor in the motion picture colony found it inconceivable, they said, that he should have been mixed up with a woman, particularly in such a way as to incur some one's mortal hostility.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER He Had No Enemies, Says Former SweetheartNeva Gerber, petite and beautiful film star, who at one time was engaged to marry William D. Taylor, but who broke off the match because she said both believed it unsuitable, said last night: "I have never known a finer, better man than Mr. Taylor. He was the soul of honor, a man of exceptional culture, education and refinement, but possessing a reserve which very few were permitted to penetrate. "So far as I know, he did not have an enemy in the world, although he had mentioned casually of fights he had on his various trips to the Klondike. "He had led a most eventful life, and told me, on one occasion, of being in a village in the far north when it was scourged by smallpox. He went about nursing the inhabitants, including a priest. The epidemic was a severe one, and practically every one was stricken, or had fled to escape this pest. Finally he and the priest, I think it was, were the only two left. The priest had fallen a victim, but Mr. Taylor nursed him back to health. "Then Mr. Taylor fell victim to the disease, and, after a hard battle, the priest nursed him back to health. "In spite of this experience, he often said to me that he longed for the far north with its great open stretches, its mighty mountains, and the solitude of its hills and valleys. Often when he was nervous and tired from directing a picture he would tell me that he longed again to be going over the trail in search of gold, and far from the distractions of civilization. "He told me that he made two fortunes, and spent both of them on his return from Alaska. "Before the war he frequently received letters from his mother who was then in London, and his daughter, who I believe was then about 11 years old. His mother, I understood, was killed in an air raid on the British capital. "He always spoke of his daughter as 'the child,' and was planning, about two years ago, to bring her to Los Angeles to live. It is my understanding that his former wife is now living in New York. "I always assumed he was divorced, for had he not been, I do not believe he would have asked me to marry him. We were engaged for some time, but we finally came to the conclusion we were not suited to one another, so the prospective match was broken off about two years ago. This terrible affair is all the more mysterious because it was a common saying among the studios and in Hollywood generally that Mr. Taylor had not an enemy in the world. "He may have made an enemy in the past who nursed a grudge through the years which finally resulted in this murder, but he never gave the slightest indication to me of having any foes."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER Los Angeles, Feb. 3--Mabel Normand, one of the last persons to see William D. Taylor alive when she visited his Alvarado street home Wednesday evening to borrow a book on philosophy, denied emphatically today that she was or ever had been engaged to Taylor. "We were pals of the golf course, fellow students in French and both enjoyed delving into philosophical subjects--that was my relation with Mr. Taylor. Just pals," she said. Miss Normand was recovering this afternoon from a nervous collapse which she suffered when told of Taylor's murder. "I wish to deny also the statement attributed to me that Mr. Taylor had told me of premonition of his death," added Miss Normand. "I never heard him mention any fear for his life or fear of any person or persons. "Although we were good pals and had many interests in common, I was so slightly acquainted with his personal affairs that not until I read it in the papers did I know that Mr. Taylor had a daughter."...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER Mary Miles Minter, motion picture star, who said she had always considered him the "most perfect man" and who was one of the first to call at the Taylor residence after the murder became known, said: "It is ridiculous for any one to intimate that Mr. Taylor and I were ever interested in each other in a sentimental way. "I have known Mr. Taylor since I was a little girl. He has directed me in some of my best pictures and I have always loved and admired him almost as one would a father. "Immediately after mother told me of his murder we hurried to his home. I have often been there with my mother or grandmother and when I came fact to face with Henry, his colored servant, I burst into tears yesterday. "One newspaper said I had hysterics," continued Miss Minter. "Perhaps I did. Mr. Taylor was an old friend of the family and I have known him ever since I was a child playing child parts. "I used so often to call Henry, his faithful servant, over the telephone and ask him if Mr. Taylor had remembered to eat his dinner, or to tell him to be sure that Mr. Taylor had plenty of covers on his bed, as it was a cold night. "As far as I know, Mr. Taylor was never married. "I do not believe that he was engaged to Mabel Normand. Miss Normand and myself are very good friends and I am sure I would have known had they been planning to marry. I think that Mr. Taylor found Miss Normand a lovable and rather boyish pal and that was all there was to it. "For the last three and a half years I have known Mr. Taylor very well, although during the last five months or so I have scarcely seen him, having been so busy with my work. He directed me in 'Anne of Green Gables,' Judy of Rogues Hollow' [sic], 'Nurse Marjorie,' and 'Jenny be Good.' "Mr. Taylor was always the man we all pointed to when any one asked us to name a representative man of the profession. "No, I never heard him mention having any fear of any one, and I am positive he had no premonition of trouble. "I have wept hours since his death and I expect to weep a great deal more. For Mr. Taylor was one of the most splendid and fine men that I ever expect to know."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 KANSAS CITY TIMES Los Angeles, Feb. 3--The dainty figure of Miss Claire Windsor, moving picture actress, was rudely thrust today into the weird mystery in the murder of William Desmond Taylor. A week ago Wednesday night Mr. Taylor and a prominent moving picture star called at the home of Miss Windsor's mother, Mrs. G. E. Cronk, in Third avenue, and asked to take Claire to a party at the Ambassador hotel. Claire went. It is said that Taylor some few days later took Miss Windsor to another party and that nothing was heard of her again until yesterday morning, some hours after Taylor was found dead. Just what connection there may be between the murder and Miss Windsor's unexplained disappearance from home, if there be any connection, could not be learned. Mrs. Cronk could give no explanation. There has been no effort on the part of the police, as yet, to get in touch with Miss Windsor.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 ST. LOUIS GLOBE DEMOCRAT Los Angeles, Feb. 3--...Howard Fellows, chauffeur, employed by Taylor, and Henry Peavey, negro servant in the Taylor home, were closely questioned by the police today. As a result of the inquiry the police say they definitely fixed the time of the slaying at about 8 o'clock Wednesday night. According to Fellows, he appeared at the Taylor home at 7:45 o'clock and rapped at the front door to summon his employer. The lights were burning, he said, but there was no response to his summons. Fifteen minutes later, he said, he tried to raise Taylor on a telephone without success.

F. Reddick, who thought she heard a shot some time in the night between 1 and 3 o'clock, but who said yesterday she was not even sure it was a pistol shot now. "I was awakened by some sharp, sudden report," said Mrs. Reddick, "but I have so frequently heard almost the identical sound made by an automobile that I could not say positively what it was, nor could I be sure of the time. I do know, however, that it was quite late, because I sat in my living room almost exactly opposite Mr. Taylor's front door, reading until very late and heard nothing like a shot the entire evening." Mrs. Myrtle B. Pratt, who lives at the entrance to the court, says she saw no suspicious character either entering or leaving the place and that she had heard no unusual sound of any description. Mrs. J. K. Lawrence, who also lives at the Alvarado street entrance, said: "There are so many automobiles passing here all of the time and their back-fire explosions are so similar to a pistol shot that we have gotten so we pay no attention to them whatever. I have no recollection of hearing anything that sounded like a shot at any particular time during the evening in which the shooting occurred, but I might have heard a dozen such sounds without feeling the slightest alarm. I think every occupant of the court should try to recollect anything he or she saw which might in any way throw light on the event." Mrs. Charles Cooley, living two doors from the Taylor residence, said that she and her husband were sitting in their living room reading almost the entire evening and did not hear a sound. They had their blinds drawn and had no occasion to look out, so saw no one. Mrs. Arthur W. Watchter, stated that she and her husband were out for the evening and returned late, but that they did not notice lights burning anywhere. Both she and Mrs. Cooley voiced the idea that people were entirely too unobservant of things going on around them, and Mrs. Cooley said: "When I think that such a kind, fine man as Mr. Taylor is said to have been, was right here helpless, at the mercy of a fiendish murderer when some of us might have gone to his aid and saved him, and we only known what was going on. It seems that we all live too much to ourselves and that there ought to be some better mode of communication between us all.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Woman Tells of Seeing Man Acting SuspiciouslyAn excellent example of habitual observation was brought to light yesterday when Mrs. Ida Garrow, a modiste living at the Rose of Sharon apartments, told Examiner investigators that on Wednesday night as she was walking down Ocean View avenue, at the intersection of Alvarado street, she noticed a man acting in a very peculiar manner. "It was about eight thirty, or possibly twenty minutes of nine, said Mrs. Garrow yesterday, "Wednesday evening and I was hurrying to my club which meets at the corner of Grand View and Ocean View avenues. I was late for a class that is studying Hebrew which I did not want to miss, but as I have trained my observational faculties in the study of astrology it is without voluntary effort that I perceive whatever comes within the range of vision. "As I came to Alvarado street, I saw a tall, slender, smooth shaven policeman, whose face I would instantly recognize if I were to see him again, walking toward Ocean View avenue. Walking with him was another man, to whom I did not pay any particular attention, because my curiosity was aroused by the peculiar actions of a man who was coming toward me a few feet in front of the policeman. Although the policeman was not paying the slightest attention to this man, the man was glancing back apprehensively over his shoulder, and at times looking in, away from the street, which would be directly in toward the court where the body of Mr. Taylor was found. "As the policeman got closer to this man, the man crossed the street, and I noticed as he crossed that he was short and stout and wore a long overcoat, but there was the shadow of a building falling at such an angle that I could not determine whether he wore a cap or a hat." Who was the policeman walking down Alvarado street at 8:30 or 8:45, and what did he see? This slight clue given by a careful observer may lead to very important developments in the mysterious murder, whose points are still baffling the keenest detectives of the city.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER Taylor Made Death Threat, Says ActressClaire Windsor, beautiful motion-picture star, last night added a sensation to the mystery of the slaying of William D. Taylor, the popular picture director. She asserted that she had heard the dead motion picture director declare that "he would kill Sands, the former valet, if he ever laid his hands on him." "Mr. Taylor, Tony Moreno and Betty Francisco were at the Ambassador Hotel at a party on Thursday night one week ago when Maurice, the famous dancer, first gave his exhibition," said the film actress. "Mr. Taylor was with me, and of course we talked about the robbery. "He said: 'If I ever lay my hands on Sands I will kill him.' "Mr. Taylor seemed very determined because Sands had robbed him of every cent he had at the time. Speaking of her friendship with Taylor, whom she referred to in terms of the greatest respect, Miss Windsor said that she had known him a long time but never very well. "I always found him a perfect gentleman, always considerate of others and most polished," she said. "While I never worked under the direction of Mr. Taylor, I met him a number of times. Mr. Taylor made no secret of his plan to kill his valet, as he told a number of people that he would kill him if he ever got his hands on him." Pretty Betty Francisco, the little blonde motion picture star, yesterday told of the party she attended at the Ambassador Hotel when Antonio Moreno was her escort and the late picture director was the companion of Claire Windsor. She referred to the slaying of Taylor with horror. "I did not know him intimately enough to call him a friend, but I would be proud to call a man like him my friend. I was rather an acquaintance, and not fortunate enough to be a friend. "It has been stated that I was with Mr. Taylor at the Ambassador Hotel. This, however, is not true. I was at the hotel with Mr. and Mrs. Bryant Washburn. Mr. Moreno and Miss Claire Windsor also were at the Ambassador, but I did not see Mr. Taylor. "I never recall his speaking of any trouble he had with any one, but on one occasion he spoke of a servant of his who was taken ill with tuberculoses. He felt very badly about it. This must have been nearly two years ago. Last night at the home of Claire Windsor, 1042 Third avenue, the mother of the film actress told of the many books Taylor had recommended to her daughter to read.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 ARIZONA REPUBLICAN Los Angeles, Feb. 3--...Ted Taylor, the director's agent, but not a relative, told of a telephone call his chief received last Monday.

Taylor, a close friend of both Mabel Normand and the slain man said yesterday that Miss Normand had been engaged to the director. While nothing definite had been settled it was generally understood, according to this source, that they were to marry. "Of course, Miss Normand was much sought after by young men in Los Angeles," said this informant. "But I'm quite sure none of these affairs was serious. Miss Normand simply would have a pleasant evening with one of them at a dance or a party, and promptly forget all about it. If the young man called her by telephone afterward, as likely as not she'd wonder where she'd ever heard his name before. "Some one of these young men might have resented her acquaintance with Taylor. It's hard to say. I never heard of anything that might lead one to think some woman was jealous of his friendship for her." Another report brought forward in motion picture circles here was that the director and Miss Normand had feared trouble of some sort and that they had made plans secretly to have a wedding to head it off... The report that Taylor had been engaged to Mary Miles Minter was scouted by her friends here. For one thing, it was pointed out that her recent reported engagement to Thomas E. Dixon, son of a pencil manufacturer, seemed much more substantial than any of the romantic affairs in which Miss Minter has been mentioned, and that this engagement was denied emphatically by both the youthful star and her mother, Mrs. Shelby.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 4, 1922 BOSTON HERALD Los Angeles, Feb. 3--...[Charles] Maigne left the central police station after being in consultation for more than an hour with Captain of Detectives J.

He came here from the East, they say, shortly after the actress came. ...The figure of Miss Claire Windsor, moving picture actress, was rudely thrust into the mystery yesterday. A week ago Wednesday night Mr. Taylor and a prominent moving picture star called at the home of Miss Windsor's mother, Mrs. G. E. Cronk, and asked to take Claire to a party at the Ambassador Hotel. Claire went. It is declared that Taylor some few days later took Miss Windsor to another party and that nothing was heard of her again until yesterday morning, some hours after Taylor was found cold and stiff in his luxurious apartment, a bullet hole in his body. Miss Windsor could not be found today. Her mother said she was "out on location" with Marshall Neilan, a director. At the office of the director this was denied. Neilan, it was said, was on location, but not Miss Windsor. Just what connection there may be between the murder and Miss Windsor's unexplained disappearance, if there be any connection, could not be learned. Mrs. Cronk could give no explanation. "My daughter knew Mr. Taylor," said Mrs. Cronk tonight. "But the first time she ever went out with him was a week ago Wednesday night. "Mr. Taylor came with an actor whom I do not know. I thought nothing of it, for a long time ago Mr. Taylor was her director, and, besides, Claire goes out to dinner parties and dances nearly every night. The ways of the movies are queer and not for me to ask questions about. "I had not seen Claire since Sunday--not until this morning--but I thought nothing of that either. You see, she has a little boy three years old and he disturbs her when she sleeps at home. So she had a couch put in at her studio and she sleeps there in peace and no baby crying to wake her up. "When she didn't come back, I wasn't particularly worried. I thought she was at the studio. She got home this morning and said to me, 'Isn't it too bad. Mr. Taylor has been murdered. Such a nice man.' Then she left to go out somewhere on location." There has been no effort on the part of the police as yet to get in touch with Miss Windsor; but every effort is being made to learn everything possible about Taylor, his life, his friends and his enemies. All Hollywood is being raked; all the queer meeting places of the movie actors and actresses, directors and assistant directors, cameramen and extras--restaurants, beauty parlors, dens where opium and marihuana and other strange drugs are common, dens where men and women dress in silk kimonos and sit in circles and drink odd drinks--are being visited. Everyone who has come into contact with the slain director, no matter how remotely, is being questioned. Things that may shock the world of moving picture fans, are destined to come out of the mystery, it is said. Peculiar stars, male and female, may be scorched and smirched before the police investigation is over. And all the sins of the cinema colony will be made known. Dope fiends will figure in the tale before it is all told and strange effeminate men and peculiarly masculine women. The police are working now on two theories. One is that a beautiful woman is in back of the affair, someone of the hundreds of beautiful women of the studio world. Perhaps she was a woman scorned, or the sweetheart of another man, perhaps--but there are many motives and the police have not yet decided on any. The other theory is that an enemy made in that mysterious part of the dead man's life, which he so well kept from his friends in Hollywood, was the murderer. It is almost certain that a man committed the murder. A man was seen before and after the shot was heard, according to Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean, who live in the same court of apartments, and the other witnesses. And the shot that ended Taylor's life came from a .38 weapon, a gun deemed too big for a woman to carry. The man is presumed to have entered the Taylor apartment while Taylor was escorting Mabel Normand to her automobile, bidding her goodby. The shot came a few minutes after Taylor re-entered the house. There was no attempt at robbery. Taylor's pockets had not been emptied. His jewels had not been touched. Not a drawer in the four rooms had been opened. If the intruder had meant to rob, he shot too quickly and became frightened and fled. Yet, according to the MacLeans, the man who came out of the front door of the Taylor apartment just after the shot--a tall man, roughly dressed, with cap pulled down on his head and a muffler around his neck--showed no signs of fright. He stood in the doorway and looked back, then departed--in such a way that no suspicion was aroused in the minds of those who saw him. A thief fleeing in terror after a murder would not act that way, the police assert. There are too many strange incidents connected with the affair also, the police say, to admit of the theory that a bungling burglar fired the shot. There have been many mysterious telephone calls, according to the negro man servant and cook, Harry [sic] Peavey. The phone would ring and no one would answer. Was it someone who merely wished to be satisfied that Taylor was at home?... The detectives are still searching for Edward F. Sands, Taylor's former secretary, who is said to have departed from the household some time ago while Taylor was abroad, taking with him numerous trinkets, also the Taylor motor and some forged checks. A peculiar thing in the minds of the police is that both Sands and Peavey are of a queer type, affected, given to feminine ways. Peavey was placed under arrest a few days ago and serious charges were made against him... Taylor, fifty years old, supposed to be a bachelor, lived in a cozy four- room apartment with his man servant, Harry [sic] Peavey, a queer chap, with a high, squeaky voice, a man arrested a few days ago charged with a serious offense. Peavey was proud of his cooking; he made the finest rice pudding to be had in Hollywood. And he liked to crochet doilies and scarfs and things. Taylor lived alone with his books and his pictures and with Peavey. Howard Fellows, a likable young chap, drove the big automobile. ...He loved jewelry, had lots of it. Perhaps the chain diamond ring, valued at $2,500 is best known to his friends. There was perhaps $20,000 worth of jewels in the apartment when Taylor was killed. His friends described him as witty, the girls say he loved to tease them. Recently, say his friends, he had been visiting the queer places in Los Angeles, where guests are served with marihuana and opium and morphine, where the drugs are wheeled in on tea carts, and strange things happen. "It is not odd," they say, "he was looking for color."********************************************************************************************************************************************************** Back issues of Taylorology are available on the Web at any of the following: http://www.angelfire.com/az/Taylorology/ http://www.etext.org/Zines/ASCII/Taylorology/ http://www.silent-movies.com/Taylorology/ Full text searches of back issues can be done at http://www.etext.org/Zines/ or at http://www.silent-movies.com/search.html.
