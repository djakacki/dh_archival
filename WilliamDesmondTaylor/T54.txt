Below are some fragments of information not mentioned in those two books, which may be of use to future biographers of Mabel Normand.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *October 5, 1912 MOVING PICTURE WORLD The old Bison plant at Edendale has now been turned over to the Keystone company, which comprises among others Fred Mace and Mabel Normand, with Mack Sennett as director, and split reel comedies are being turned out at a merry rate. The company is working much faster than its schedule of releases so as to pile up a surplus against possible accidents or other interruptions. Last week Sennett completed a 500-foot comedy in a single day and claims a record on the feat. The Keystone company is a distinct organization, having no official connection with any other motion picture company, although it is owned by men who also own the New York Motion Picture Company as well as other motion picture concerns.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *December 7, 1912 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Some of the friends of Director Ince, of the Kay-Bee Company, decoyed him to the Venice Country Club the night of November 15, where he was made the victim of a gigantic conspiracy. When he arrived there were about 300 grown-ups waiting for him to remind him in a vociferous manner of something that had entirely slipped his mind, namely, that it was his birthday. Never mind, it was one that comes after 21. All the members of the Kay-Bee and the Broncho companies were present and a number of specially invited guests from other motion picture companies in the vicinity, among the latter being Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand of the Keystone, and Mr. and Mrs. James Young Deer of the Pathe Western Company. There was a banquet, an impromptu entertainment and a dance and it took until nearly 4 o'clock in the morning to run through the program. During the evening they made Ince stand up and look sheepish while a presentation speech was made as a preliminary to handing him a topaz ring, the big stone surrounded with small diamonds. The topaz is supposed to have special significance for those born in November. After that Ince made a speech forgiving everybody for their share in the conspiracy.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 12, 1913 LOS ANGELES TIMES Little Mabel Normand, leading woman with the Keystone company, who is to lead the grand march of the photoplayers' ball with President Mace, Saturday evening, has had many hazardous experiences during her career as a photoplayer. She says that while most people believe there are not risks to be taken in the making of comedy pictures, conditions are quite the reverse. In comedy, with which Miss Normand has been identified since her advent into the picture-making profession, action alone scores. In dramatic pictures, the spectator is given time to fathom the story and the action is much slower. "In comedies," asserts the dainty little Mabel, "we have risks as great, if not greater, than those necessary in dramas. "About a year ago, I made an aeroplane flight with the late Phil Parmalee. It was my first time in the air. We reached an altitude of about 1000 feet, and suddenly the engine went dead. It seemed that one could have heard the proverbial pin drop. "Gliding down, we landed unhurt. Mr. Parmalee discovered that his gasoline had been tampered with; and in some way paraffine had worked into the carburetor. When I was told of this, I realized the danger to which we had been exposed; but the picture had to be made, and several more flights were necessary." Miss Normand has had many adventures, such as being thrown from cliffs and into the ocean; but aside from a few scratches and bruises, she has never been injured. A short time ago she was tied to a rock in Santa Monica Bay, about 100 feet from the shore. The continual breaking of the waves over her body washed her adrift. She has always been considered a clever swimmer, but was unable to successfully battle with the waves in her weakened condition. As she was sinking, members of the company came to her assistance and carried her to the shore. "With all its risks and hard work," says the little actress, "there is a certain fascination about the profession which holds one. I went into pictures three years ago without any previous experience, out of a convent. Since then I have played in a picture and a half a week without a break. They say I have made good and I will very probably play in pictures for the rest of my days."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 26, 1913 LOS ANGELES TIMES Mabel Normand started something big when she appeared at the Garrick Theater in person Thursday night and was introduced during both performances. This custom is to be followed regularly, and Fred Mace is to be introduced tomorrow evening. After the members of the Keystone company have all been presented the Tannhauser company is to be introduced one and a time. When Miss Normand appeared 1500 feet of films in which she was shown were run off.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *June 7, 1913 W. A. Cory MOVING PICTURE WORLD There was something doing every moment on Photo Players' Day in San Francisco. The Motion Picture Exhibitors' League worked hard to make May 2nd, a day worthy of remembrance, and they were paid for their efforts by a grand turn-out all along the line of the parade. A fact worthy of note in passing was the general comment by everyone that there were three times as many people lining the curbs to watch the parade as there were the previous day to see the big circus parade. The excitement began at 9:30 in the morning, with the arrival of Mabel Normand of the Keystone Company, Carlyle Blackwell of the Kalem Company, and Miss Anne Schaeffer and George C. Stanley of the Western Vitagraph Company. The players were met by the State Secretary, W. A. Cory, and representatives of the Golden Gate and General Film Exchange, who took the players to their hotel, where they made ready for the pageant, which started at noon at Van Ness Avenue and Market Street. Mabel Normand having been voted the most popular player in California was chosen queen of the occasion, and occupied the first automobile with Carlyle Blackwell and W. A. Cory and wife. Then came the two Vitagraphers, and following them, Mr. Gilbert M. Anderson, the popular "Broncho Billy" of the Essanay Company, followed by twenty-four of Anderson's daring cowboys and cowgirls in picture costume and mounted on their cow-ponies. The famous old stage coach which we have seen "Broncho Billy" hold up countless times, was also there in all its glory. Several beautiful floats, representing miniature picture shows, and other spectacular features followed. Next came the members of the San Francisco and Oakland Exhibitors' Leagues in gaily decorated automobiles, headed by a band of twenty pieces. The parade made a beautiful spectacle, and proved the best sort of advertising for the ball which opened at 9:30 that night, with Mayor and Mrs. Rolph leading the grand march. Following Mayor and Mrs. Rolph, came the visiting actors and actresses, the committee in charge of arrangements and their ladies, with Anderson's cowboys and cowgirls dressed in Wild West costume, followed by the different members of the league and the dancers. The actors and actresses were introduced by Chairman Cory, and made happy little speeches, which were greatly appreciated by the great throngs present. The only one to avoid making a speech was "Alkalai Ike" who, owing to his diminutive stature was enabled to hide behind the skirts of some kind lady and could not be found until the dancing was well under way. Motion pictures of the parade, which were taken by Miles Brothers, and were exhibited on a screen, caused a great deal of merriment among the spectators as they recognized themselves in the photographs. No expense was spared in the management of the affair; the aim of the committee being to boost the business in general, rather than make money out of this particular occasion. The entire Scottish Rite Temple, which is the most beautiful building of its kind in San Francisco, was rented for the occasion, one floor being reserved for society dances, another for those who wanted to rag, large orchestras being provided in each hall. This arrangement left everybody happy, and the crowd divided up according to individual taste. The ball broke up about two o'clock Saturday morning, with everybody voting it a grand success, and eagerly awaiting next year's second annual grand ball.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *August 9, 1913 MOTION PICTURE NEWS Miss Mabel Normand, whose picture is presented on our cover this week, is the charming leading lady of the Keystone Film Company, and is considered one of the most beautiful as well as capable artists on the screen. Before her present connection with the Keystone Company, Miss Normand was well and favorably known as a clever performer, both with the Vitagraph and later with the Biograph Company. Her work with these two organizations attracted considerable attention and praise and when the Keystone Film Company was formed Miss Normand was taken over, together with Mack Sennett, Fred Mace and Ford Sterling. This famous company of fun-makers made an enviable reputation for themselves while the Biograph Company and the Keystone Film Company are to be complimented on their business acumen in securing these prominent players. Miss Normand, besides her personal charm and beauty, has an original style all her own while working in pictures and in the particular style of comedy which the above company is now making a specialty of. Miss Normand has attracted attention by her work from picture-play fans all over the country. She is an accomplished horsewoman and a champion swimmer and high diver and before entering picture work was recognized as one of the best women swimmers in the world. She is athletic to a degree and fond of outdoor sports of all kinds, in many of which she excels her male competitors.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *December 13, 1913 MOTION PICTURE NEWS Mabel Normand, leading woman with Keystone, will hereafter direct every picture in which she appears.

Miss Normand hopes to soon be able to do the loop, when a motion picture will be made.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *August 15, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Despite an article that recently appeared that Miss Mabel Normand, the Keystone comedy star, was married off to the director general of that company without her knowledge or consent, Miss Normand wishes to emphatically state that not a wedding bell in the whole city of Los Angeles or any other city ever struck a note in her behalf.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *September 5, 1914 MOTION PICTURE NEWS Not content with an aeroplane and a Mercer racer, Mabel Normand has entered the amateur field, having purchased the seven horsepower cyclecar made by Shirley Williams, age 16 years, with which he won third place in the Vanderbilt, Jr., races at Ascot Park, Los Angeles, July 4th, making the fifty miles in one hour and six minutes. The cyclecar has a speed of fifty-five miles an hour. Miss Normand has had the little racer finished in an elegant manner at one of the local garages, and for the next two months the young driver and maker of the car will use it, in giving exhibition mile runs at fairs and amateur race meets, the largest one he will attend being that at Tacoma, Wash., on Labor Day, when there will be a purse of $750 and three cups for the two fifty-mile races. [A photo of Mabel Normand in her racer can be seen in the MOTION PICTURE NEWS, September 12, 1914, page 58.]* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *September 19, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Poor little Mabel Normand wants to take a trip "back home" to New York, she confided to us one Saturday afternoon. "I've been out here ever since the Keystone started, and they won't let me go at all," she says, and that is two years ago. Mabel is busy directing her own company and is putting on some real good comedy.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *October 31, 1914 MOTOGRAPHY [the following took place in New York] The Cinema Camera Club made of its invitation party-dance on the night of October 10 a well managed and a pleasant affair. Pabst Coliseum, where the dancing party was held, was gayly decorated in tissue paper streamers of many colors and the lights turned on the dancers were of many hues. The balcony was divided into boxes and these were representative of the respective film companies. There was a grand march which began at midnight, and had as its head Clara Kimball Young and the new president of the Screen Club, James D. Kirkwood. Miss Young was a gray silken maiden of Hong Kong, she and "Jimmie" Young having chosen this costume in that city two years ago on their around-the-world trip. In her hand Miss Young held a Chinese lantern in which a candle gleamed during the march-figures in which other lights were momentarily extinguished. Mabel Normand, on from the west on her eastern rest-trip, was one of the marchers and there were many others of screen note, among whom were Edward Earl, Bessie Learn, Hughie Mack, Herbert Brenon, Alec Francis, Jessie Stevens, William Tooker, "Andy" Clark, Sally Crute, Jack Pickford, Mabel Green, Ned Finley, Alice Learn and William Wadsworth. Mary Pickford enjoyed the march from her Famous Player box and afterward joined the dancers. Ad Kessel and C. O. Baumann were in attendance, as also were Mr. and Mrs. Adolph Zukor, Mr. and Mrs. C. Lang Cobb, Jr., Mr. and Mrs. Charles Seay, Miss Bessie Bannon and Frank A. Bannon, James A. Young, Joe Varnham, Carl Gregory and David Thompson of the New Rochelle studio, Joe Brandt, Bill Barry, A. Kauffman, Owen and Matt Moore, Fred Mace, Marguerite Leveridge and others. Buttons requesting "Let us have universal peace" was the Universal's contribution to the evening.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *October 31, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD "Keystone Mabel" Normand, the renowned Keystone comedian, has been spending her vacation in New York and, needless to say, she is having the time of her young life. Being well-known in New York, previous to her going to the Coast where she has been for two and a half years, all her old friends have been waiting for this vacation and she has been wined and dined incessantly.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *December 19, 1914 MOVING PICTURE WORLD The first annual ball to be given under the auspices of the Screen Club of San Francisco took place on Saturday, November 28, at the Coliseum, 200 Baker street. The Screen Club was organized on October 19 of the present year and the holding of such a successful ball so shortly after its formation is not only an evidence of the desires of its members to make it a success, but of their energy and ability to work in harmony, as well, Sid Grauman, president of the club and one of its organizers, was chairman of the floor committee and also head of the reception committee, and stood at the main entrance during the first part of the evening welcoming the distinguished guests, of which there were a large number. Some idea of the size of the assemblage may be judged from the fact that approximately six thousand tickets were sold at the door, in addition to many that were sold at the box office of the theaters and by various exchanges. It is estimated that the total attendance was between eight and nine thousand persons. The regular reception committee consisted of sixty members of the club, while twenty of the leading city and state officials made up the honorary reception committee. The grand march was scheduled to start at nine o'clock and it was just a few minutes after this hour when the march, led by Mayor and Mrs. James Rolph, Jr., commenced its circuit of the immense hall. Following the leaders were a galaxy of moving picture stars brought from the studios around the Bay and from the southern part of the State, together with the officials of the club. By this time the crowd had become so dense that it was impossible to keep it from encroaching on the floor, and the grand march became a triumphal procession through a populace anxious to catch a glimpse of their screen favorites in person. When the floor was partly cleared dancing was indulged in, the numbers being interspersed with singing, the enactment of moving picture roles and feature acts from downtown theaters. An event of the evening was a short address by Mayor James Rolph, Jr., from the balcony of the hall. He pronounced the ball the greatest event of its kind in the history of the city and declared that it eclipsed anything he had ever seen in the line of a hall gathering. He said: "The moving picture business is here to stay, and the immense interest that is taken in screen productions can be judged by this assemblage. Much credit is due the Screen Club for the unqualified success of this event and I wish to thank it for bringing so many player folks here that we might meet them personally." He then read a list of those present and these were brought to the front of the balcony and introduced, amid great enthusiasm. Among those who were presented were: Mr. and Mrs. Roscoe Arbuckle, Mabel Normand and Charles Chaplin, of the Keystone, Mr. and Mrs. Victor Potel, Harry H. Todd, Margaret Joslin Todd, Evelyn Selbie, Ernest Van Pelt and wife, of the Western Essanay Company, Max Asher, of the Universal; Lee Willard, True Boardman, Fritz Wintermeier, Lila McClemmon and Miss Ruth Hedington. Ford Sterling planned to be present but was taken ill with pneumonia and could not come. Lillian [Dorothy] Gish was injured in an automobile accident and was compelled to send regrets. Another star who was prevented from attending through an accident was Margaret Clayton, of the Western Essanay Company, one of the first to respond to the invitation of the Screen Club. She recently suffered a fractured leg in a stage accident. The attendance at the ball steadily increased until midnight, and tickets were sold as late as two o'clock. The Screen Club expects to net a neat profit from the affair and this money is to be expended in fitting up the club rooms in some convenient location in the downtown district. A portion of the funds secured is to be donated to the Associated Charities. The remarkable success of the monster ball, as it is now known, was due in a large measure to the great publicity that was given it. For weeks before the event it was advertised in all the moving picture houses by means of attractive slides, the fact being emphasized that the leading players were to be present in person. Billboard advertising was used extensively and a real old-time circus stunt was used during the week preceding the event, this being the handing of colored banners on the span wires of the downtown trolley system. A very attractive program of fifty-six pages was distributed, but, owing to the unlooked for attendance, this was given only to the fair sex and was much in demand. This contained pictures of the officers of the Screen Club and of some of the leading actors and actresses in the moving picture profession. It was well filled with announcements from Western producers, exchanges and the local theaters. An interesting feature was the dance program, consisting of fifty-five numbers, each of which bore some distinctive name of general interest. A few of these selected at random were: Keystone Rag, Sterling Two-Step, Chaplin Three-Step, Dorothy Gish Dip, Bronco Billy Gallop, Arbuckle Walk, Slippery Slim Two-Step, General Hesitation, Tivoli Three-Step, Dahnken Glide, Mary Pickford Waltz, Kleine Two- Step, Bunny Hug, Crone Rag, Lesser Two-Step and Kohn Lame Duck...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *March 23, 1915 PHOTO-PLAY REVIEW The Lady on the CoverMiss Mabel Normand...is at present directing all the comedies in which she works.

She was in San Francisco at the time and when the report reached her ears she sent the following telegram to the Keystone studios at Edendale: "To all my friends in the Keystone, Greetings: Be assured that I am not married and have no such thought. Some foolish person evidently thought to perpetrate an April fool joke which was both cruel and misplaced. My love and best wishes to you all. Please post on bulletin. Mabel Normand" At about the same time Mr. Levey sent a wire discharging the press agent. Levey is not even a friend of Miss Normand--merely an acquaintance of the most casual sort, having met her in connection with the "Tillie's Punctured Romance" feature which Mr. Levey controls in several states.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *June 27, 1915 Clem Pope NEW YORK TELEGRAPH (Los Angeles)--Pretty soft for some of these Keystone actors this nice warm weather. While the mercury is trying to blow out the top of the bulb, the water in the Keystone tank gurgles merrily while the actors do the sea nymph stuff. The other day Fred Fishback, in diving in the plunge, misjudged the distance and collided gracefully and firmly with the concrete wall, and was rendered temporarily helpless. Mabel Normand did the Carnegie stunt and saved him. Sure I know that Fred Palmer is a publicity man, he has to make a living some way.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *July 17, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD Last week the Los Angeles Baseball Club held a benefit for the widow of "Hap" Hogan, who died here recently. The picture people gave their generous support, there being representatives from several companies to draw the crowds. Charlie Chaplin and some Essanayers were there, and Ford and Mabel, with Roscoe, frolicked around on the lawns. James Snyder, while taking part in the funny ball game, fell and broke his shoulder.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *July 31, 1915 MOVING PICTURE WORLD ...The crowning event of the convention [held in San Francisco, July 13-17, 1915] was the grand ball, held in the Municipal Auditorium in the Civic Center. This event had been widely heralded, and extensive preparations made, a feature of the arrangements having been the bringing from Los Angeles of almost fifty prominent screen artists from the leading studios. As was the case with the convention itself, the task of arranging the details of the ball devolved upon the chairman of the Convention Committee, M. E. Cory, and much of the credit for the success of this affair must be given him. Owing to the fact that the historic old Liberty Bell arrived in San Francisco late Friday evening, some of the plans for the ball had to be changed at the last minute and many of the dignitaries of the state and city were unable to be present until the festivities of the evening were well under way. Governor Johnson, who was to have led the grand march with Geraldine Farrar, was a member of the committee that brought the historic relic to the exposition grounds and unfortunately could not be present. Mayor Rolph was also absent, but representatives of the city government were on hand to grace the occasion. The gathering of screen favorites was fully up to the expectation of the ball committee, and during the early part of the evening the boxes they occupied were surrounded by eager throngs of admirers, the floor officers finding difficulty in keeping the crowd moving. In keeping with the exposition and Liberty Bell spirit which prevailed, the hall was tastefully decorated in the exposition and national colors, and after the commencement of the grand march the scene was further enlivened by the releasing of hundreds of colored balloons. The grand march was led by Carlyle Blackwell and Blanche Sweet, followed by other leading picture players, the new and retiring officers of the National League and the state and local organizations. Following this, the regular dance program began and lasted until the early morning hours. Owing to the immense size of the auditorium, and the fact that many who attended were onlookers occupying seats in the balcony, the floor was crowded at no time, and the attendance was larger than appeared to be the case. Motion Pictures were taken of the grand march by Mills Brothers. Mr. Sciaroni was in charge of the lighting and photographing. The pictures were shown at the Empress theater on Saturday evening... Among the player folks and film men who were present and occupied boxes were Geraldine Farrar, Blanche Sweet, Carlyle Blackwell, Mabel Normand, Raymond Hitchcock, Mrs. Raymond Hitchcock (Flora Zabelle), Mack Sennett, Owen Moore, "Diamond Jim" Brady, Barney Baruch, Fred Mace, Marshall Neilan, Ella Hall, Robert Leonard, Hobart Bosworth, Hobart Henley, M.

The white lights beamed merrily for them, the cup of joy effervesced, and the plaudits of admiring throngs for their real selves brought a novel pleasure. In plain vernacular, Fatty and Mabel are on the job in New York. With their Eastern Keystone Company, including Minta Durfee, Al St. John and others, they arrived in the metropolis Thursday afternoon, December 30. The party came through direct from the Coast, escorted by Traveling Passenger Pike of the San Pedro Road. They were met at Grand Central Station by Frank Myers of the New York Central, and a number of the New York Motion Picture and Triangle executives. Miss Normand is looking fresh as a daisy, but it was deemed best not to break the journey for picture-taking en route, since her recovery from serious accident has been so recent. Mr. Arbuckle, the director of the company, said he would start work soon at the Willat studios in Fort Lee. Mrs. Ford Sterling (Teddy Sampson) and Syd Chaplin were among the friends who greeted the newcomers at the station. On New Year's night, Mr. Arbuckle, Miss Normand and the other Keystoners were the guests of the New York Globe at the Lexington Opera House. They saw "Peter Rabbit in Dreamland," and two thousand people saw Fatty and "the Keystone girl" and applauded the flesh-and-blood authors of millions of laughs. After the hard, grueling work at Edendale, the Keystone folk enjoyed every minute of the New Year's festivities.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *March 4, 1916 Lynde Denig MOVING PICTURE WORLD Garden Capacity TaxedMadison Square Garden accommodates the population of a fair sized town. For small affairs like the circus or the horse show it does very well, and the architects designed it for just such moderate demands with never a thought of magnetic motion pictures. They did not foresee that on the night of February 19 so many New Yorkers would insist upon entering the Garden because of the first annual ball arranged by the Screen Club and the Exhibitors' League. Five, eight, ten thousand, so the numbers rose, until along towards midnight the police and fire departments cried, "Enough." Uncounted hundreds were turned back to the sharp wind in Madison avenue. And to think, had it only been June instead of February, had the breezes been less keen, Gail Kane, burdened with diamonds; Clara Kimball Young, more glorious than ever after her stay in Cuba; Florence LaBadie, on her towering float, might have visited an overflow meeting in Madison Square Park. The incense wafted from Miss LaBadie's throne must have given "Arabian Nights" dreams to the men who sleep in the open. But it was too cold. Visitors at the Garden were divided into two classes, those who came to see and those marked for the spotlight. Members jammed the aisles until congestion was slightly relieved by the opening of the second balcony. The others, those who came to be seen, occupied the boxes encircling the arena, converted into a dancing floor. In the center was a stand large enough to hold several bands. Joe Humphrys and various officials of the Exhibitors' League and the Screen Club. Publicity promoters, every so busy, kept in close touch with Announcer Humphrys and effected a wireless communication with manipulators of the spotlights. Arthur James, Harry Reichenback, Leon J. Rubenstein, Paul Gulick, P. A. Parsons and others expert at adding lustre to a star improved each passing moment. Metro was on especially friendly terms with the decorator. In whatever direction the eye wandered it met giant banners bearing a simple declarative sentence, such as "Metro Wins." Attention was drawn to the well-filled Pathe boxes, including that of the Arrow Film Corporation, by the name displayed in electric lights; Universal had Red Feather banners galore floating above the heads of the dancers, whereas Thanhouser, Triangle, World Film and Equitable, Vitagraph, Edison and other box holders figured in the decorations. Shortly after eleven o'clock there was a flurry of excitement caused by the entrance of Clara Kimball Young, soon to be named as the winner of the Popularity Contest. By this time the floor had been cleared of dancers and the arrival of each screen celebrity was befittingly ceremonious. Then World Film-Equitable Reichenbach opened the game in earnest by leading his trump card--Gail Kane, resplendent in diamonds and an orchid-colored gown. Lights were lowered to make more effective the play of the "spot" on Miss Kane and her jewels as she circled the Garden, accompanied by an Hawaiian quintet and an escort of police officers. Metro followed with a miniature operetta, enacted by a score of girls in Pierrot costumes bearing letters to spell "Metro Wins." They danced to the tune of "Hello, 'Frisco," easily altered to "Hello Metro." Then those who came to see, witnessed the sad spectacle of a man in evening clothes reeling across the floor, all too obviously unable to control his movements. It was Billie Reeves in a comedy interlude. King Baggot and Edna Hunter led the first delegation of Universal stars and while they were going the rounds, Director Sullivan, of Thanhouser, was marshaling his forces for the spectacular entrance of Florence LaBadie. Looking like a veritable queen of ancient history, lolling gracefully in a golden chair, carried on the shoulders of Nubian slaves, she was the center of a splendid procession. No beauty of the screen ever was given a more gorgeous setting and her triumphal march brought applause from every corner of the Garden. Violet Merserau and Hobart Henley guided an assemblage of Red Feather stars around the circuit, and a few moments later the great popularity of Anita Stewart and Earl Williams, leaders of the Vitagraph delegation, was attested by a generous ovation. Presently Mr. Reichenbach, filling the place of Announcer Humphrys for the time being, called attention to the box in which a popular actress was seated. The spotlight plainly indicated Clara Kimball Young, who soon appeared on the floor, with Nicholas Dunaew, in a striking Russian costume. In the second Thanhouser promenade there was a liberal New Rochelle delegation. The crowd roared its approval when Roscoe Arbuckle and Mabel Normand appeared. Edison made a good showing with Viola Dana and Richard Tucker in the lead, whereas an imposing Universal assemblage had President Carl Laemmle and Pat Powers as its center. Accompanying these officials were Violet Mersereau, Hobart Henley, King Baggot, Sydney Bracy and Dorothy Phillips. Frank Powell appeared with Nance O'Neill, Alfred Hickman, Victor Benoit and Mr. and Mrs. William Teller. Gail Kane made another circuit of the building and the Screen Club and White Rats each had their turn. Among Biograph players were Claire McDowell, Charles H. Mailes, Vola Smith and Vera Sisson. Nicholas Power was represented by Jack Skerrett, Edward Earl and William Barry. It was past midnight when Joe Humphyrs announced the winners of the New York American's popularity contest and awarded the prizes, first, a $500 diamond bracelet to Clara Kimball Young; second, a $75 wrist watch to Anita Stewart, and third, a traveling bag, to Virginia Norden. Each of the winners appeared on the platform and acknowledged the applause of fellow players and the public. Miss Young and Billy Quirk, president of the Screen Club, led the grand march, followed by Lee A. Ochs, president of the Exhibitors' League and Miss Stewart. Edwin Thanhouser, duplicating his offer at the Boston Exhibitors' ball, agreed to feature with Miss LaBadie, the girl selected as the most beautiful at the ball, the only stipulation being an amateur standing. The platform was immediately besieged by hundreds of eager young women and it appeared for awhile as if the Thanhouser Company had staged a riot or a bargain day. The committee of five, comprising Lee Ochs, Otto Lederer, Tefft Johnson, Frank Carroll and John Humphyrs, finally chose Pearl Shepard, of New York Public School No. 23. An enjoyable feature of the evening was the entertainment furnished by Metro in the concert hall on the balcony floor. Refreshments were served to Metro guests and an orchestra supplied music for dancing, Mary Miles Minter being among the hostesses. Among the out-of-town guests were Siegmund Lubin, who brought Helen Green and several other players from Philadelphia; Frederick J. Harrington, president of the Exhibitors' National Organization; Ernest H. Horstmann, president of the Massachusetts League; Frank J. Howard, Samuel Grant, Russel E. Shanahan and H. H. Buxbaum. The box-holders were: Metro, nine boxes; Pathe, six; Universal, six; World and Equitable, five; Mutual, four; Triangle, four; Vitagraph, three; N. Y. American, three; city officials and judges, two; Fox, two; N. Y. Motion Picture, two; Edison, Great Northern, Frank Powell, Nicholas Power, Greenwich Lithographing, Robert Warwick, Marshall Farnum, King Baggot, Ivan Film, American Seating Col, Novelty Slide, Lubin, J.

The affair was given in honor of Browning's twenty-third birthday. Miss Alice Wilson had charge of the arrangements. Browning was taken to the downtown district for dinner. One of the members of the party soon after the dinner pleaded a severe headache and they all adjourned to the Reiter Arms, where Browning was met by the three hundred guests who were invited to the affair, including notable film people from the various studios in the motion picture colony. Charles Murray, the Keystone comedian, acted as master of ceremonies, and welcomed Browning home with a traditional Keystone bit of comedy. A buffet luncheon was served in the Reiter Arms ballroom, and the evening was spent in dancing. Among the guests were Mr. and Mrs. Edward Dillon, Chet Withey, Mabel Normand, Fay Tincher, Dorothy Gish, Robert Harron, Wallace Reid, Dorothy Davenport, Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd Ingraham, J. C.

They found a good-natured man over at Fort Lee who loaned them his house. The interior of the house was too dark to take pictures and there were no lights available. As he simply had to have an interior, Sennett moved his friend's furniture out on the lawn and took the "interior" there. When he came to settle the automobile bill that first day Sennett had to dig up twenty dollars. As the whole payroll of the company only amounted to fifteen dollars at that time, they decided they would have to cut out the automobile. Thereafter the little Keystone company plodded out to work every day in the street cars. And when the actors got to the end of the street car line they went on the human hoof. The cameraman carried the camera over his shoulder and the actors packed the props on their backs. Being very husky by nature, Sennett took to himself the honor and distinction of carrying most of the scenery on his own back.... In September, 1912, Mack Sennett and his players came to Los Angeles and took possession of the studio that had been the original site of the Bison company. The older division of the New York Motion Picture Corporation had removed to Santa Ynez Canyon near the end of 1911. It wasn't much of a studio. A vacant lot, a couple of dilapidated sheds and a rickety stage were about all. Mack Sennett did most of the work himself. He wrote all the scenarios, lent a hand with the scenery, acted as telephone girl and gateman most of the time. After the day's work as an actor, he came back at night and cut film until early morning. When Sennett's first California comedy was sent east the verdict was quick and positive. It was punk [terrible]. Nobody would buy it. With bulldog tenacity he struggled on. Finally he landed with a comedy in which he had no faith and which was a careless makeshift affair. A Grand Army of the Republic convention happened to be in Los Angeles. Without any very definite idea in mind, Sennett had his cameraman take pictures of this parade. From another company he bought some cast-off battle pictures. He rigged up one of his comedians as a soldier, had him dash in and out of some smoke from a smudge pot and make up a ramshackle comedy out of it. For some reason or other, this was an instant hit. The East demanded more like it. The Keystone found itself all of a sudden on the map. The demand for Keystone comedies soon became so great that the one little company couldn't meet the demand. Another company became absolutely necessary. Where were they to get a director and how were they to pay for a director? Mabel Normand threw herself into the breach. She offered to direct a company herself. Miss Normand, accordingly, became the first woman director of comedies. The actors who worked in her first company say there were occasionally some wild scenes. She was not what you call a phlegmatic director, but she was a good one...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *June 24, 1917.

Beginning at 8:30 in the evening at Marcus Loew's American theatre, Miss Normand made a two-minute talk first to an audience on the roof-top theater and a few minutes later met the audience in the main ground floor theatre. Thereafter, she averaged one theater every fifteen minutes, appearing at Mitchel H. Mark's Strand theater at 9 o'clock. Marcus Loew's New York theater came next at 9:15 and was followed by trips to Loew's Circle, Loew's Lincoln and Loew's New York roof. The last stop of the evening was at A. L. Shakman's Eighty-first street theater. If there was any need of the affection in which Mabel Normand is held by the public this Liberty Loan speaking tour was all that was required. In the course of the evening she faced a total audience of from 18,000 to 20,000 persons and the greeting they gave Goldwyn's beautiful little star showed that her power is as great as ever.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *December 28, 1918 Grace Kingsley LOS ANGELES TIMES Just as Mabel Normand, Goldwyn star, was happily settled in her Hollywood home, and was planning a nice house-warming party, along came the flu and not only threw cold water on all her nice little social plans, but stopped work on "Sis Hopkins."

Mae Marsh, who has been ill for some time, has so far recovered that she is to commence work on a Goldwyn production on January 13. Her director will be Roy Trimble, and the story is not yet ready for announcement. Mabel Normand, likewise expects to be able to don her "Sis Hopkins" make-up within a few days.

The fact which principally matters is that I'm happy to be back here in California." "Aren't you lonely for New York, then?" "Lonesome!" exclaimed Mabel. "Yes, lonesome as a traffic cop at Seventh and Broadway on Saturday afternoon! Why, all my friends are out here, and they've been just too lovely to me for anything. Even when I had the 'flu' they kept me jolly with letters and telegrams and flowers and candy I couldn't eat. But I'll tell you a secret. I got a chance to read a lot of books I've been wanting to read for a long time. Just as Carlyle used to read yellow-back novels as a rest from serious labors, so the joyous comedienne as tragedy relief, so to speak, turns to highbrow literature. So I've been reading history and all kinds of stiff things, with H. G. Wells as the very lightest one of all!" Of course it wouldn't be Mabel's picture, "Sis Hopkins," unless some funny little human thing happened during the making of it. This time it was a dog, which relieved the sad motonony of comedy making. A scene on which depended an important development of the story was one in which a dog sniffs at "Sis's" market basket and in doing so overturns the oil-can, which rolls into the spring, and--but there, I mustn't tell any more of the story. The point is, the dog must do all those things. But none of the dogs brought to the studio could be brought to enact the combination of incidents. Then Mabel made a suggestion. "Why don't you go to the pound and get a poor, starved cur," was Miss Normand's happy suggestion. "It will eat anything." Sure enough, a poor, neglected, dirty fox terrier was chosen and brought from the pound. "And it was right then," said Miss Normand, "he became a ham actor. He showed a ravenous appetite for ham. In his hunt for ham, the oil can was overturned, tumbled beautifully, and rolled right into the spring. And the play was saved." Of course, Miss Normand insisted the forlorn canine be kept at the studios, and she calls him "Ham," and says hunger will make a good actor of anyone.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 2, 1919 Grace Kingsley LOS ANGELES TIMES Mabel Normand is still somewhat weak from the severe attack of influenza which she suffered a few weeks ago.

When "Mickey" was offered State-right buyers a couple of years ago J. Frank Hatch, one of the cleverest of the State-right purchasers, offered $8,000 for Ohio, refusing to raise his bid. He could have bought it for $9,000. Harry Grelle, of Pittsburgh, paid $12,000 for Ohio and $10,000 for Pennsylvania for a three years' lease of the picture, which still has a year to go. Up to date Grelle has cleaned up a profit of $323,000 on Ohio and Pennsylvania, the bulk of which was made in Ohio. At the conclusion of the lease of "Mickey" Grelle will retire, satisfied with his accumulated "pile." The picture was put into Pittsburgh for a run which cleaned up a profit of $60,000 on the engagement.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *May 1921 PHOTOPLAY ...And we can now present to you--Mr. and Mrs. Tom Moore.

She received and accepted an invitation from her producer, Mack Sennett, to take dinner with him and a friend, at his home. The hour was set for 7 and as usual Mabel was on time. As Mr. Sennett escorted Miss Normand to the dining room, which was darkened to that time, the lights were turned on and eleven of Mabel's friends rushed her to wish many happy returns of the day. A beautiful three-piece silver tea set was the gift of the entire company. Many less pretentious gifts were presented from the people who worked with her on the last picture, "Molly 'O," including an alarm clock from her director, Dick Jones.

Vying in half a dozen qualities these two famous clubs of the West and the East promise a lively rivalry hereafter... "The Writers' Cramp" was the occasion of the affair. Just how the cramp originated is not made public, but it is generally supposed that it was first noticed in the region of the pocketbook when equipment for the "Writers'" new athletic field was to be provided. In a spasm of optimism some one--they do say it was Marion Fairfax-- conceived the idea of raising money to allay this cramp by a big public gathering. The public was entirely willing. In fact, some 1200 strong, Mr. and Mrs. Public responded with such a rush that the baby stars of filmdom who were selling tickets had to requisition trucks to carry home the money. Whatever the financial result, the social development of the affair was remarkable. Folk of the studios met society on terms of equal footing, and a bond of common interest created which will make last night's dinner dance one of the memorable events of local history. The array of distinguished men and woman assembled would alone have been worth all the price of admission. The fact that the cotillion form of dance was observed permitting every guest to dance with his or her screen favorite was a further pleasure provided, and finally a specially staged entertainment of wit, beauty and music completed the brilliance of an affair which every guest may recall with happiness for years to come...

The ceremony was performed in the First Methodist Church of Hollywood by the Rev. Dr. Willsie Martin, its pastor, and in the presence of nearly every motion picture star on the Pacific Coast, to say nothing of several hundred residents of Hollywood and Los Angeles. Following the wedding, the bridal party, accompanied by a few intimate friends, went to the Ambassador Hotel, where a wedding dinner was served. This morning Mr. and Mrs. Fisher will leave on an extended honeymoon jaunt. Where are they going? They refuse to tell. The wedding ceremony was marked by its beautiful simplicity and lasted less than ten minutes. Long before it began, though, the guests, both those of the motion picture colony who knew the couple well and those who have met them through the "silver screen," had gathered outside the church. The doors were not opened until a few minutes before seven-thirty, the hour set for the marriage. When the guests were finally admitted the large edifice was filled within a few seconds and so large was the crowd that failed to gain admittance that a detail of police officers from the Hollywood station was pressed into service to handle it. Arrangements had been made for the bride and groom to enter the church from different vestibules, but when 7:30 came and it was time to start the wedding march, "Mary and Doug" had not arrived and there was a short delay. Miss Rupp arrived early with her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Pickford, and her brother, Jack, who was to give her away. When "Doug" and "Mary" arrived there was a hurried whispered conference of all the party and "Doug" was sent into the church to take his seat with the other members of the family. "Doug's" appearance was the signal for an enthusiastic outburst of applause from the ensembled guests. It was enthusiasm that could not be kept down apparently, thought the edifice was a church and the occasion a wedding. The object of the outburst, however, appeared none too well pleased and attempted to gain silence by nodding his head. It had no effect. Many times have the members of last night's wedding participated in beautiful wedding ceremonies before the camera, but last night, face to face with reality, the appeared lost, and they frankly admitted they felt that way. Miss Rupp was attended only by her sister. There was no bridesmaid and no ring bearer or flower girls. Just as the wedding march commenced, when Miss Rupp and her sister and brother were waiting in the vestibule to start the processional, "Our Mary" pleadingly asked what she was to do. "I'm nervous," she said, and she meant it. "I'm nervous too," responded Jack. "Don't ask me." "Well, let's go in," added the bride. There was a hurried scamper and Mary took a position before the other two. No one was quite sure which arm Jack was supposed to offer the bride but with the aid of a reporter they finally were straightened out and started into the church. Mary, forgetting her nervousness, head in the air and looking straight ahead like a little grenadier, led the bride and her brother up the side aisle and down the center of the chancel. Both the bride and her maid-of-honor were beautifully gowned and both deserved the subdued exclamation of homage that came from the standing guests. The bride has always had an honest claim to be called pretty. As for Mary--well, who is there in the world who doesn't know of her almost childlike beauty, and she never looked prettier than last night. The bridegroom and his best man, Eddie Sutherland, were waiting near the foot of the chancel and as the bride and groom met, Doctor Martin entered from the chancel door. Almost, it seemed, before the audience realized the ceremony had begun, it had finished and the recessional began. There was a mad rush on the part of the guests to reach the street before Mr. and Mrs. Forrest were driven away. Only a few, however, succeeded in getting near them. The ushers, Hoot Gibson, Al Roscoe and Harry Cohn, anticipating just such a move, saw to it that bride and groom were well on the way to the Ambassador before the church was half emptied. Other members of the family made their exit from side doors and they too were whirled away from the huge and curious crowd. "Doug" may have held up the wedding by being just a little bit late but he managed to get to the hotel before the rest of the party and was in possession when they arrived. Among the guests at the wedding dinner were Mr. and Mrs. Tom Moore, Thomas Dixon, Steve Franklin, Hoot Gibson, Harry Cohn, Al Roscoe, May McAvoy, Mabel Normand, Mr. and Mrs. Urson, Lila Lee, Mrs. Charlotte Pickford, Mary Miles Minter, Bebe Daniels, Alice Lake, Mr. and Mrs. Canfield, Eddie Sutherland, Mr. and Mrs. Scott, Jack Pickford, and "Doug and Mary."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *December 22, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES E. M. Asher, personal representative of Mack Sennett...confirmed that Miss Normand sailed on the White Star Line steamship Majestic last Saturday, December 16, to spend Christmas in England... Confirming Miss Normand's return to Europe, which she visited in the summer, Asher said she sailed rather suddenly, "with a party of friends," on the Majestic merely to spend Christmas in London. He said she had advised him she would sail on her return voyage two or three days after Christmas. He denied the disclosure of Wally Reid's breakdown had any connection with her sudden departure from the United States, but admitted she decided on the trip somewhat unexpectedly.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *June 1923 Herb Howe PHOTOPLAY ...It was while chatelaine of the Beaux Arts that Texas [Guinan] first drew the eastern filmers together, achieving a big financial and social success.

Dines, an oil operator from Denver, who is a friend of Miss Purviance. Dines, according to first reports, was fatally hurt. Later reports are more optimistic. One is that neither lung was pierced. After the two moving picture actresses had been questioned by the police and released they saw to it that Dines was properly cared for in the Good Samaritan hospital. The chauffeur who fired the shot is H. A. Kelly, alias Greer. The first word of the shooting came to the police from Kelly himself. He arrived at the university police station and said: "I have just shot a man over at 325 North Vermont Avenue." The police hurried over to the bungalow at that address. They found the women weeping over Dines who was reclining on a sofa. "I guess somebody shot him, Mister," said Mabel--with the right amount of cheer in her voice. Later Kelly, the chauffeur, was booked on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and the women were released and allowed to go home. The place where the shooting occurred, which had been rented by Dines on his arrival from Denver six weeks ago, is a unit in a beautiful series of court bungalows. Edna, who is said to be his fiancee, had been there much of this afternoon. There had been obviously an abundance of drinkables. Miss Normand says she went to the apartment at 8 o'clock p.m. in her limousine and told her chauffeur she would call him when she wanted him. "He came in about 9 o'clock or some time," Mabel said in the police station, "without being called. Honest, nobody invited my chauffeur to the party. Why the--well, why should we? "And all of a sudden there's some shots. And poor Dines is hit. "Honest I never saw the shooting. I didn't know nothing about it. I was in the other room, putting some powder on my nose, or maybe smoking a cigarette or something. And Edna was with me--see?" Edna's story was much the same; but rather vague and indefinite. It was plain though that she was doing her best to recollect. But she had forgotten much. She had even forgotten to button her shoes, until she saw a burly cop grinning at her ankles. Then Mabel's chauffeur, whom she knows as Greer, told his story. He said he wanted to protect Miss Normand. "This guy Dines has got a lot of booze," he explained to the interested police and newspaper men. "And he's been keeping poor Mabel so bleary-eyed that she can't do anything. I felt sorry for the kid, and I determined to put a stop to it. "So this afternoon I went up to Mabel's room. And up in Mabel's room I found this little gat. "Well, about 8:30 o'clock I takes Mabel over to this Dines' place--on the way to the depot. She was going to see some friends off to the east, Mabel's great like that. Do anything to cheer a friend. She had some flowers--she's always giving flowers to everybody. And she though she'd just step in and say "hello" and "happy New Year's." "I waited an hour for her to come out. And she didn't come. So I went into the place. "I saw that Mabel was in no condition to stay there any longer and that Miss Purviance was--well, anyway, I said, 'Come on, Mabel, we're going away from here.' "She told me I was a kill-joy and that I wasn't a gentleman if I insisted on going around killing her parties. "I got rough with her--like any man would. And I told her if she didn't come and come right away I'd chuck up the job. I wasn't going to 'chauf,' her around if she insisted on getting drunk every time she could. "Well, she got up and put her arm on mine and we started out. "Then this guy Dines started to pick up a bottle. I thought he was going to hit me with it. I'm no roughneck; I'm no cave man. Look me over-- you don't see no ladies' delight about me. Little guy, I am. And him--well, you seen him, didn't you? "I wasn't going to let him crack me over the dome with no bottle--no matter if it was a real Haig & Haig bottle. And I pulled the gat and let him have it." Greer fired three shots, and then ran out to the police station and told the police he had "just shot a guy." It was really an affecting meeting, that of the movie stars and the oil man, in the ward of the shabby little receiving hospital. It was approximately two hours after the shooting and the girls, having finished with the police quiz, had become almost cold sober. They were led from the detective bureau by a crowd of admiring cops. Edna, dressed in a cloth of gold evening gown, gold satin slippers and gold silk stockings, with a wrap of gold and green; and Mabel, a Gainsborough picture in black velvet--and plenty of ostrich feathers on her hat. "Gimmie a cigarette," begged Mabel just before the procession to the receiving hospital began. "O, daddy," was Edna's greeting to Dines in the hospital. She took the wounded man's hand in hers and kissed it. The light shone on a big diamond--Edna's. "Is my sweetie hurt?" she asked of Dines. The tears began to fall in great splotches from the blond lady's eyes. "No--I'll be all right," said Dines. "'Lo, Sweety," said Mabel, with just that exact note of cheer needed for the sick room. "Hoy's the sweety?" Edna shoved up the gold bandeau--it threatened to drop over her eyes, and bent and kissed Dines. "What do you think of that guy saying I tried to hit him with a bottle--" Dines moaned. "Get me a drink of water." "All my fault," said Mabel, still the cheerfullest soul in the room. "Say, he told everybody I saw the shooting. Huh--and if he says it again I'll take a couple shots at him." Mabel pushed Edna out of the way and repeated that it was all her fault and that she ought to take a couple of shots at somebody...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 3, 1924 Edward Doherty CHICAGO TRIBUNE (Los Angeles)--Jan. 2--Mabel Normand and Edna Purviance, movie stars, who were present when Mabel's chauffeur shot Edna's sweetheart, Courtland S. Dines, last night, will have to tell their stories to the police at least once more. ...An unvoiced, passionate love for his "movie queen" employer and jealousy of her host is believed by the police to have caused Horace A. Greer, the driver, to shoot Dines. But Mabel herself objects strenuously to this view; "A chauffeur with a gun!" she said tonight. "Deliver me." Mabel was more articulate today but not so full of pep. Her fingers trembled a little as she lit a cigarette. She had just been reading the newspapers and the police version of the affair seemed to anger her. "Blah, blah," said Mabel. "Slush, the poor boob was nuts. He was only one of the servants, and he was treated like one. Why, I didn't even treat him like--well I've had a lot of good chauffeurs. And good gawd, I didn't even hire this egg. My secretary did that." Some one asked Mabel about the gat. "Well my gawd," she said, "I didn't know how he had it. He says he got it out of my room. What business had he in my room--my bedroom? Say, I hope I drop dead if this ain't the truth--that man had been in my room only twice that I know of--once to fix my curler and once to fix an electric plug. Honest. "Somebody gave me that gat to shoot bottles with. I broke a lot of nice mountains shooting at bottles, but I had a lot of fun. And he says I was in the room when he cut loose with the gat, and he wasn't shooting at bottles, either. I wasn't in the room at all. I was in Edna's room. She was putting on her evening gown and it wasn't hooked up and I didn't want this egg to see her. "Then all of a sudden, bang, bang, bang. I thought they were firecrackers. The kind I used to throw at Ben Turpin. Poor old Ben, he'd look at me so funny." Mabel tried to give an imitation of Ben doing the east and west and nearly strangled on cigarette smoke. Edna was lying in bed when the reporters came. She was dressed in a nightie and a pretty orchid kimono. Her blond hair was sadly disturbed, and her eyes were hidden by dark glasses in horn rims. She remembered some details overlooked or unrecalled last night. She was quite certain today that Mabel was with her. "Yes, I was powdering my nose," she said, "and Mabel came in and said, 'Don't be a pig, Eddie, let me see Mabel in the glass and give me some of your powder.'" This coincides with Mabel's story--but it is directly opposed to Greer's. "Mabel was sitting on the davenport," he said, "and she had just put her arm on mine and we were going out when Dines makes a grab for that bottle and I let him have it. Mabel screamed." Greer said today he meant to fire only one, but he shot three bullets out of the gun before he knew it. The gun jammed on the fourth shot. "Why," Edna said, "that chauffeur just came in the door and started shooting. That's all there was to it. No argument or anything so far as I know." Edna is not going to lose her job with Charlie Chaplin because of the trouble--but Charlie plows nervous hands through his crinkly gray hair. "The poor kid," he says, "she's worried stiff. She doesn't know whether she's going to be fired or not. Of course I'm not going to fire her. We all get into trouble some time. "But whether she will have the lead in my next picture--I--uh--have a cigar. You see, we've been trying out a lot of people for that role. We've been trying to get a girl who is smaller than Edna, and --well, I don't know. "But of course her present trouble has not a thing to do with that. You understand how types are cast? That's it. We want a certain type for the lead in my new picture." There was talk during the interview with Charley and Edna about a little strip of film showing a man removing a splinter from Edna's beautiful knee. "My God," said Edna. "But you wouldn't publish that," said Charley. "What would be the point?" "No, we're not going to print that picture," the newspaper man assured him. "We haven't found it." Edna explained that she was and she wasn't engaged to Dines. For about six months, she said, she and Court had an understanding, and, although he hadn't given her a betrothal ring they intended to get married. She added that she was terribly fond of the wounded man. Edna then proceeded to touch more in detail the high spots of the evening's events. "I had promised Mr. Dines to have dinner and in the middle of the afternoon I dropped in at his bungalow. There were some others there, too. It was a sort of New Year's open house all over Hollywood and there were callers at the bungalow through the whole afternoon. "Soon after reaching the house I went to a telephone and called Mabel and asked her to come on over. It wasn't long till she arrived. Her chauffeur, Greer, brought her over. "Folks kept dropping in and finally, shortly before 7, Mr. Dines said he'd step into his room and dress for dinner. "None of the three of us were intoxicated. We had some drinks, but not many. Only a moment, it seemed, after Mr. Dines started to change his clothes for dinner and just after Mabel and I were in a room leading off the living room--powdering our noses--the three shots sounded from the other room. That's the whole of it." The police theory is that Greer was in love with Mabel, and that he wanted to pose as a hero, a caveman, in her eyes, and take her away from the man who was giving her booze. "I wouldn't ever aspire to love such a wonderful, beautiful, great movie star," Greer said today. "Me, one lung, a little guy? I like her and all that, and she's been kinder to me than anybody I ever me. Gave me some platinum cuff links Christmas day. Big hearted, that's what she is--always doing something for somebody. "Well, I told you how Miss Burns, Mabel's companion, got a call from her, asking to have me sent over to Dines' for her. And how she told me a man took Mabel from the phone and hollered that she wouldn't be home. I went over there. I knew Mabel had to have an operation, for I guess it's appendicitis. And I knew it wasn't doing her any good to get soused. But you know Mabel--she can't say no--too darn good hearted." Edna told reporters this afternoon that Mabel hadn't called Miss Edith Burns, her housekeeper, or anybody else. "I was with her all the time, of course, and I know she didn't use the telephone," she insisted.[These last two articles were written by Edward Doherty. In his autobiography, "Gall and Honey: The Story of a Newspaperman", Doherty told of visiting Mabel Normand in the hospital at a later date, at which time she told him, "Eddie, I thought you were the devil himself, because you always quoted me exactly as I talked."]* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *September 1924 PHOTOPLAY Did you ever run ten blocks to a fire and then find that it was only some measly little woodshed burning? Sure you have and so have we. In fact that is about the only kind we ever did run to until recently. And then we felt repaid for all the futile miles we had run. For this fire was different. It was a garage fire and among the eight garages blazing was one that belonged to Mabel Normand. And in her garage was a spick and span limousine. It was and still is the pride of her heart, despite the fact that the flames damaged it about $1,000 worth. But it was not the burning or saving of her limousine that made the fire such a success from the spectators' viewpoint. The fair Mabel furnished the excitement. Aroused from peaceful slumbers, she rushed to the garage clad only in her pajamas, slippers and a filmy something thrown over her shoulders. She has appeared in many fire scenes in pictures but never to better advantage than she did that early morning. The dashing comedienne took command of the firemen in directing their work of saving her garage and limousine, and no firemen ever worked harder or more valiantly than did those gallants of the Wilshire fire station. When it was all over she took them into her home and served breakfast. It was some fire and some breakfast.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *October 1924 PHOTOPLAY At last Hollywood has seen Douglas Fairbanks' "The Thief of Bagdad." No picture ever made has been awaited with such eager interest by the film colony itself, and the opening night at Grauman's Hollywood theater was one of those unforgettable occasions, marred only by the absence of Doug and Mary, who were somewhere on the high seas, bound for America. The scene was an amazing one, from the crowd that packed the streets outside, to the interior of the theater, transformed for the production of this picture into a veritable Arabian Nights palace, filled with incense and Oriental perfumes, magnificent tapestries and rich colors, dancing girls and throbbing Eastern music. In the audience were Norma Talmadge, Constance Talmadge, Madame Alla Nazimova, with the most fascinating new bob above a frock of gold and coral; Florence Vidor, in cream chiffon with orchids; Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Meighan, Mr. and Mrs. Harold Lloyd (Mildred wore the daintiest of Boue Souers frocks under a summer evening wrap of pale pink chiffona du marabou); Mr. and Mrs. Reginald Denny (Mrs. Denny in a smart taffeta frock of blended pastel colors); Mr. and Mrs. Earle Williams, the latter stunning in cloth of gold and flame net; Miss Jeanie MacPherson, wearing a gorgeous evening coat of green silk shot with gold and banded with gold embroidery; Mr. and Mrs. Walter Morosco (Corrine Griffith), Paul Bern, Mabel Normand, all in white satin trimmed with rhinestones under an evening wrap of ermine; Mr. and Mrs. George Archainbaud, Kathleen Clifford, in scalloped white chiffon ornamented with red silken roses; Mae Busch, black and silver; Jack Pickford and Marilyn Miller, Mr. and Mrs. Allan Forrest (Lottie Pickford), Mr. and Mrs. Robert Leonard (Mae Murray--in some shimmering white and silver thing, with a coat of delicate canary yellow); Mr. and Mrs. Norman Kerry, Priscilla Dean, in autumn leaf brown, with a big picture hat of the same color; Mr. and Mrs. Conrad Nagel, Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Ray, George Fitzmaurice, Eugene O'Brien and Mr. and Mrs. Monta Bell.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *December 1925 Herb Howe PHOTOPLAY When Mabel Normand went East to appear on the stage she listed her house for rent...the agents rented it to Barbara La Marr.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *February 1926 PHOTOPLAY Upon her return from Europe, Irene Rich was honored by the Warner Brothers with a dinner dance at the Casa Lopez. She looked charming as ever, but was quite apologetic because she hadn't had time to get a new gown for the party. You see, Irene had taken her two daughters to Europe and placed them in school in Switzerland, and their stay in Paris was spent outfitting the children. So Mamma was neglected. Nevertheless, the line formed to the right of Irene's table, and it took all four Warner Brothers to fight off her prospective dancing partners. Mabel Normand in an ermine wrap looked well and happy. Natacha Rambova made her usual striking appearance in her draped turban. Clive Brook and John Roche were among the most popular dancing partners. After the dinner and some dancing, the Warner Brothers' newest opus, "Lady Windermere's Fan," was run off for the guests...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *December 1928 Harry Lang PHOTOPLAY [from an interview with Hollywood psychic George Dareos, discussing the stars who come to him for psychic readings]..."I know all the stars--they all come to see me," Dareos went on.
