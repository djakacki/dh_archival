February 4, 1922 OMAHA BEE A Tragedy of the Movies

The latest "release" from Los Angeles cinema colony is that of a thriller that promises to run through more than one reel. It is the tale of a murder, sordid, perhaps, in its intimate details, yet possessed of the one attribute dear to the producer's heart, that of mystery. How or in what manner it will end is just now beside the case. That wonderful community of abnormal personalities will continue to hold a fair place on the front page for some time yet because of this unpretty contribution to the record its habitues have made. Will H. Hays will find in it at least one of the minor problems he will have to deal with, although it is conceivable that the regulation of the private lives of the actors who disport before the camera is not included in the business management of the great industry. Unfortunate though it be, the assembling in more or less forced intimacy of considerable numbers of persons of both sexes whose code of personal behavior is not the rigid sort that pervades the general walk of life, is likely to produce results that shock the world by their nature. Nothing shown on the screen has so far exceeded in weirdness the things actually done by the movie players. Men and women in other walks of life have suffered by similar tragedies, but it is the movie stars' misfortune in such cases that millions of people had interest in them. Their every act almost, even those of personal conduct, are on a public stage.

February 4, 1922 WICHITA EAGLE Another Movie Scandal?

Another typical California murder has been staged in the movie colony. William Desmond Taylor, wealthy movie director, ex-husband of two [sic] women and alleged prospective husband of at least as many more, is dead of gunshot wounds, and police are questioning men and women known to have been on intimate terms with the director. Several million-dollar names are being bandied about, and the stage seems to be all set for the interesting unraveling of another movie scandal. Under the shadow of this tragedy, Fatty Arbuckle ought to be able to sneak away and become insignificant enough to escape further public notice.

February 4, 1922 CHICAGO TRIBUNE "How Different from the Home Life of our Dear Queen"

David W. Griffith, the moving picture producer, in expressing his regret that some one had shot William Desmond Taylor, also a producer, in his Los Angeles home, said that he hoped people would not be led to false ideas of moving picture domestic life and social ideals and would not unjustly criticize the moving picture colony in Los Angeles. He would be grieved if through false impressions anything discreditable to the screen profession prevailed to its injury in the public mind. We believe that he need fear no such misfortune. The moving picture industry, as the public gets glimpses of it from time to time, seems to possess some delectable isle where the charm of life is never withered and only occasionally marked by some romantic murder and subsequent murder trial. If sometimes the movies appear as unreal, it is only because we view them from the actualities of our own experience and do not know that they are interpretations of realities in the life of the moving picture artists. For them there are swans on the lake, Russian wolfhounds stand beside the automobile, and whenever there is an evening party the ladies and gentlemen have a frolic in the marble pool in the pink moonlight, while the ju-ju birds bill in the cypress trees. On this delectable island the law of cause and effect does not run. Prohibition is not a cause and abstinence is not an effect. Wherever the enchanted people go cocktails precede them and highballs follow them. Even death, when it enters, comes on velvet feet, with a Cecil De Mill composition and David Wark Griffith direction. This is the life, as Mr. Griffith's publicity matter describes the "Orphans of the Storm," "when people went dancing, singing, loving, and taking, as they pleased. The lawless--but not loveless--city in that cyclonic last act. From the storehouse they took gold and silver and precious stones, from the storehouse they took satins and silks to make alluring--" It is much too much. We cannot go on. But what a life! The director, having said good night to his faithful colored servitor, is alone in his beautiful house, reading Freud. Rare things of art and wealth surround him. A cocktail mixer stands at his elbow. Sunset glow. A dove in the red cedar calls to its mate in the willow. The Russian wolfhounds doze in their kennels. A beautiful lady in a beautiful car arrives, eating peanuts. Peanut shells are all over the beautiful car. The handsome chauffeur sweeps them out while the director reads Freud to the beautiful lady in the twilight beside the cocktail shaker. Mae Tinee says that some low down realist, finding his reason shaken by the combination of beautiful lady eating peanuts and fatherly man reading Freud to her, was driven to murder. Possibly, but he never went to the movies much, or it would not have jarred him. Nightfall and the brilliantly lighted house. Midnight and another beautiful lady casually stops for a good-night chat. The door bell rings, but otherwise it is a house of silence, because it is a house of death. One fatal shot has rung out in the night and shadowy mystery waves the curtains as the sun comes up. The Tribune sent Mr. Doherty to the Pacific coast to report the murders and other social advantages of that region, and he has been busy ever since. He was asked if he did not want to take a rest and come back home. He replied that he would resign first.

February 5, 1922 MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL Movie Crimes Becoming Real

Surely is the city of pleasant make-believe in the luxuriant state of California coming to the attention of the nation through realities that are by no means pleasant. One crime seems to tread upon the heels of another in the great moving picture colony with each succeeding one more lurid and dispiriting than its predecessor. While one member of this community of luxury and license awaits his fate on a sordid charge of manslaughter another is mysteriously shot to death, and the details surrounding his murder seem to point to conditions even more ugly and sordid than the preceding one. Newspaper correspondents peeping behind the veil of mystery say that revelations in the newest tragedy will go beyond the drunkenness and sexual lubricity of the other one to the dismal depths of drug-crazed minds and bodies. It would seem at least on the face of things as if sins of sexual license and violent purpose even in the make-believe are two-edged swords that can do damage to the wielder as well as to those for whom they are wielded. We have become more or less acquainted with the evils that such portrayals may work upon those who witness them, but have not know so much about the reflex action upon the portrayers. Psychologists and psycho analysists may argue the point as to whether the moral laxity of some of the pictures is the cause or is the effect of the moral turpitude of some of the producers. But their argumentation will not alter the obvious fact that an unwholesome atmosphere seems to pervade this city of make-believe. Time was, as is recorded in Holy Writ, when two cities of the Palestinian plains not so far from the Dead Sea so offended the Creator by their vices and concupiscences that He rained down fire and brimstone and destroyed them in their sins. Some modern cities, and among them this movie community of mimic life, dare also to tempt the wrath of the Supreme Being. They may have no such calamitous visitation as is recorded in Genesis, but they are at least bringing about the contempt of decent-minded people and by so doing are destroying the golden opportunity that is theirs. Besides, the guilty members of this colony, each and every one of them, are feasting themselves solely upon Dead Sea fruit.

February 5, 1922 IDAHO STATESMAN "Reel" Values

The real tragedy of William D. Taylor may eclipse in sensation any of the reel ones he directed. It involves murder and mystery, assumed names, actors and actresses of wide reputation, luxurious environments; in fact, all the necessary ingredients of the movie thriller. There is an unfortunate side to it. We are likely again, as in the Arbuckle case, to have the private life of each of several prominent screen people uncovered and dissected. Many a man would blush, blameless as his past may actually have been, to have that past studied as Taylor's may be and as Arbuckle's was. Few people live to middle age without having been guilty of an indiscretion or two at which they are vexed in secret. This engineer-actor-director who has gone by the name of Taylor may have been something of a Don Juan and, in the course of his moving picture life, much engaged. It may even be that this is not the worst that can be said of him; but he is dead now and we would prefer to be charitable, though, charitable or not, we are, it seems, to have the facts thrust upon us. Perhaps they will leave us a little more disgusted with those who have contributed to our delight in the movies. Taylor was successful as a director; that does not mean he was successful as a man. Many an actress thrills us; until we find, unexpectedly, to our sorrow, that she failed to live as well as she acted. A few more of these disillusionments and we may lose our respect for these hired entertainers who dance and mimic for our amusement. We have idolized them too much, heaped favors too high upon them, given them too high a status in our modern life. It may be about time to readjust ourselves and give them, in our minds, their proper and lower place. The girl with the wind-blown hair and glowing cheeks one meets at the corner grocery, buying a yeast cake for her mother, may be better in soul and of more real use to the world than any of these actresses. The genial lad who wraps up our collars at the store may be as interesting, as likeable, as morally sound and as successful in the end as any director who, megaphone to mouth, has bellowed, "Action! Camera!"

February 6, 1922 CHARLESTON GAZETTE Crime and the News

A tragedy in the moving picture colony in Los Angeles, coming in the wake of the tragedy in a San Francisco hotel, in which performers were involved, again turns the searchlight on the industry and has a tendency to cast odium on the performers as a class and Hollywood as a place of their abode. One has only to visit southern California and Hollywood to see the lure of the place. The climate is wonderful, it is not tropical, yet all the exotic things to be found in the tropics are found in this comparatively temperate zone. But, a few days at the place will prove an eternal verity so that the atmosphere will get one as some lotus blossom deprives one of rational ideas and wafts them on the wave of emotions to pleasant dreams. The "movie" colony is also one recruited from the ends of the world. The world's butterflies have assembled there, but, in addition, practical business men and legitimate performers of all kinds have loaned or sold their arts and energies to the making of pictures which has got such a hold on the public that the industry is said to be the fourth largest in the United States in volume of money spent on their making and showing. It would be unfair to say that there is more immorality in the moving picture colonies that anywhere else in the country, although the setting would be perfect for excesses of all kinds. At times there are as many as 40,000 persons engaged in one way or another in the industry in Los Angeles and environs. A few days ago a player and director was murdered. It was the first crime of a similar nature in the colony for years. The identity of the murdered man, his importance to the industry, and the fact that there is some mystery as to the identity of his slayer, have all the elements which would appeal to the scenario writers engaged in the industry. But the incident has again startled the critics, and, while there is no necessity, it seems to offer a brief for the industry, there are some facts that might be cited. In the city of Charleston homicides are not unusual. The court records would show an astonishing number. A murder here is news which is relegated generally to a place of secondary importance, but California has a way of advertising itself which sometimes assumes the form of exploiting notoriety. In the present instance, as in the Arbuckle case, the industry of making pictures gets more notoriety than is deserved. It is very natural that there should occasionally be a scandal in a community as large as Hollywood, and it is just as natural that occasionally some hatred should find expression in one individual slaying another. We do not know the statistics relative to homicides in Los Angeles, and it is not our intention to magnify the number in Kanawha county, but it would be interesting to print the facts. We are certain that there are less in Los Angeles than there are in Kanawha county although Los Angeles has half a million inhabitants. The facts seem to be, however, that the public and the press give much importance to news items such as the killing of Taylor. But there is a defense for the tendency to print in detail the stories of such crimes. One is the public demand for the details. The press, purveyor of news, must have it to sell. One of the reasons why the newspapers of America today are the greatest mediums of advertising is because they are the most widely read mediums. If they ignored the news they would not be read. Pulitzer said that "crime was news," and a poll of all the people would probably prove that at this time the latest murder mystery of Los Angeles was discussed in more homes yesterday than was the morning sermon in the churches.

February 6, 1922 NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Moviedom's Garbage

William Desmond Taylor's murder has lifted the lid of moviedom's garbage can. The odor arising is not sweet. A filthy mess is being revealed as the police delve into the crime. The murder is the climax of a series of revolting divorce cases, dope parties and other nasty affairs. From Hollywood, center of the motion picture business, come many stories of orgies. Too many stars of the screen have been paraded before the public in a mantle of vice. In a general way folk on "the inside" have known of these things. It has taken the Arbuckle case, the Valentino-Acker divorce suit and the Taylor mystery to lift the lid for the public gaze. A portion of filmdom, at least, seems to need a good cleaning. The capable and energetic Mr. Will Hays is the gentleman to administer it. The movie business has been hurt as a result of the escapades of some stars. Cow-eyed "heroes" and star-eyed "heroines" have not lured crowds to the box offices as of yore. There are good reasons. Movie stars have given us many of our pet illusions. But illusions fade when one reads of shining lights of filmdom being dragged through scandalous muck. It is only fair to a large number of actors, producers and directors to point out that the individuals involved in the scandals are the minority. Frequently they are of the class exploited into stardom because of favoritism, not because of ability to act. These persons believe what their press agents write about them. Inflated heads and disaster follow. They have been the ones who have hurt the picture business. Parents don't care to see or to take their children to see on the screen in heroic roles men and women who have been involved in sordid cases. Motion picture stars are public characters. They cannot afford to have private lives. They live in glass houses, constantly on exhibit. They are idols. Some of these idols are proving to be clay. In picking these individuals out of the industry lies one of Mr. Hays's big opportunities. It is safe to predict Mr. Hays is broad visioned enough to realize this fact and to administer a spring cleaning. The garbage of moviedom--even if it has been perfumed in the past--must be dumped overboard for the good of an industry that is needed to entertain millions.

February 6, 1922 INDIANAPOLIS NEWS Hollywood Happenings

The murder last week of a movie director, and the facts brought to light by the police inquiry, throw a light on the Hollywood colony that must be painfully unwelcome, especially at this juncture, to the colonists. There is no reason in the nature of things why there should be immorality in movie circles. In the film itself there is nothing wicked--unless indeed it is an evil film--nor need any wickedness mark its production. It would be most unfair to class all together, and to assume that all those connected with the business are pariahs. The trouble seems to come from a combination of a low order of mentality and big salaries--as in the Arbuckle case. Few things are more dangerous than money in the hands of those who have no idea of its value, and not the slightest sense of the responsibility which its possession imposes. Undoubtedly there are many of these people who are not rich, but probably all expect to be, and also the pace is set by those who are rich. There do not seem to be any moral standards--hardly indeed a suspicion that such things exist. When such influences operate in a restricted community composed wholly of movie people who know nothing except their trade, think of nothing else, and have no idea of any public opinion except that of the little community in which they live and work (and "play")--under such conditions shocking things are bound to occur. To an over-supply of money and an under-supply of brains one must look for an explanation of the happenings at Hollywood. There are rumors of the existence of a circle of so-called "esthetes" which would only make the situation worse. The murdered man in the latest case was, it is said, a student of Freud, while the studies of another member of the community seem to have been divided between Freud and the Police Gazette. Of course moral depravity is by no means unrepresented in the Hollywood colony.

February 7, 1922 SACRAMENTO BEE Clean-Up from Inside Should be Movie Program

The murder of William Desmond Taylor, the film director in Los Angeles, has disclosed a story as unsavory as the details of the Roscoe Arbuckle case and rivaling that of the Thaw case of former years. Even more prominent figures in filmdom, however, have been drawn into the mess, and the impression left with the general public is that the moral tone of life among the men and women of the screen resembles too closely that of decadent Rome. Unless some drastic changes are made, the results are likely to be disastrous to the industry. A few more such malodorous incidents will result in such a wave of public indignation as may be ruinous to the business. Wise producers have scented the danger, but, for the most part, the energy thus far disclosed, has been of a hunt for cover order, rather than an honest confession that some things were wrong and a cleaning up is needed. Just lie low until the storm blows over, and then everything will resume its normal order, was the attitude of too many of the filmmakers after the arrest of Arbuckle. This attitude becomes increasingly difficult of maintenance as the result of this new scandal. If it is true that a vast majority of the people connected with the photoplay making are decent and respectable, now is surely the time for them to assert themselves. One suggestion offered is that the Hollywood colony be closed, and that a new start be made at Long Island, New York, where no orgies have occurred, and where a church would be erected to give notice to the world that in this spot Arcadia would be reborn. This sounds too much like a real estate scheme, and it does not in any way touch the heart of the situation. It is people which make or mar the character of any spot, and if the Arbuckles and the Taylors are permitted to set the pace no little church spire or change of location is going to help matters. Proponents of this scheme should remember what Lincoln said about fooling the people. Most of the trouble can be traced to the large sums of easy money which the motion picture industry has brought to individuals to whom wealth means license, and who can find only in abnormal or degrading sensations a real "kick" in life. To put a restraint on them is the only way of safety for the moving picture industry. If the restraint comes from the inside, so much the better. But one way or another, it is going to be done. That cannot be doubted.

February 7, 1922 NEW YORK EVENING MAIL Movies and Morals

It is not fair to indict a whole profession for the sins or crimes of a few of its members. But that is precisely what public opinion is now doing in the case of the moving picture actors and actresses. The recurrence of scandals in which highly priced stars and directors figure has bitterly incensed clean-minded people throughout the country. There is something more than moral indignation in that attitude, too. The average patron of the pictures comes to look with something like affection on his or her favorite players. When these players prove unworthy of admiration in their private lives, the public has a sense of betrayal. It is quite possible that there are no more instances of marital infidelity or general immorality among these personages of the screen than there are among stevedores or scrubwomen. But that is beside the issue. Those who are in the public eye owe public morality a greater debt than those who are not, because their example can do so much harm. We do not suppose that the men at the head of the moving picture industry can secure nothing but Galahads and their feminine counterparts for the pictures they make. But it is quite possible that there are conditions in the industry that could be easily reformed. One of the most prominent men in it, for instance, thinks the Hollywood colony life is bad for the character of those taking part in it. They live and talk nothing but pictures, he says, and their standards of conduct are apt to be self- determined. This seems very like commonsense, and it suggests the abolition of the colony. A higher ideal of their profession's power would also help the weak sisters and brothers in it. Probably nothing in the world will help the really vicious ones. but they without doubt are comparatively few. There is an old saw, "Let me write the songs of a nation and I care not who makes its laws." If the picture people could be brought to realize how far that half- truth could be said of their own profession, they might measure up better to their opportunities.

February 7, 1922 KANSAS CITY STAR The Defendant in the Case

It may be that the man who committed the Hollywood murder will escape, but Hollywood can't. Hollywood as a community, as a social condition, as a moral delinquency, stands indicted. The conquest of easy fortune has much to answer for. Men and women intoxicated by money, the uses of which they never had learned through the process of earning it, came to believe that the finery they wore before the camera really had translated them into persons of condition and privilege. They made themselves into a class, a species of order, and set up a new code for themselves which repudiated all the obligations recognized and observed by society. To have more money than your abilities or service entitle you to, to spend it in wild excesses, to reject the restraints of decency and outrage all public sensibilities, was to be approved a member of this order. If you passed all these tests, you might, as a mark of special favor, be permitted, if it suited your taste and convenience, to live under your own name. This is the class that has branded the motion picture industry in Hollywood. It is without principle, character or morals, and but for the Midas touch of the films would be washing dishes and peeling potatoes. It isn't intelligent, it isn't capable, it isn't profitable to the industry to which it has attached itself. But it has been lavishly overpaid in the past--a condition now fortunately drawing to an end--and with this unaccustomed wealth it has ruined itself and half ruined the screen drama. What else could have been expected? Shallow girls and uneducated men, raised suddenly from poverty to riches, without the balance of character, without culture, moral background or social responsibility, will make a swift and sure descent to the level from which they came. You can't make an eagle of a crow by sticking an eagle's feathers on him. The real defendant in the Hollywood murder is the motion picture industry. The producers will have to recognize that it is their business to maintain certain standards or to suffer the inevitable consequences in the loss of public patronage.

February 8, 1922 LOUISVILLE TIMES The Visible Kiss

The transmission of kisses by symbols is one of the oldest practices known to the human race. When two lovers were separated by some cruel fate which forbade the pressing of lips to lips they have always devised an artifice by which osculation might be typified. If they eyed each other throw a chink in the wall, like Pyramus and Thisbe they kissed the stones which separated them in token of what might happen if fortune were more kind. If the cave man wanted to send his inamorata a sign to the effect that he was kissing her in spirit, he scratched an "x" on a slab of stone and pitched it into the cavern where her stern father held her in captivity. When a Kaffir chieftain wished to thrill the heart of a dusky princess with the sentiment of kisses by "hopeless fancy feigned," he sent her the head of one of his retinue with a thorn piercing the lips. With the advance of civilization, the symbols became more refined. We outgrew Salome's idea of kissing the head of John the Baptist instead of kissing his lips while they were yet warm. Then we began kissing the finger tips from afar, and, later with the dawn of commercialized sentiment, we resorted to the distich which used to be wrapped around the "candy kiss." Then came the blotch at the end of a perfumed note, labeled "a kiss," and finally the "x," which reverted back to the cave man. The algebraic symbol, "x," stands for the "unknown quantity"; but, in modern love letters it has no hidden meaning. Indeed, it is highly obvious, as witness the chain of "x's" which Mary Miles Minter, the movie actress, strung across the bottom of a note which she wrote to William Desmond Taylor. Having piteously denied that she was enamored of the slain motion-picture director, she confessed all when confronted by her symboled kisses. Love is akin to murder in the sense that it "will out," and one of the surest indications of its existence is the penchant of lovers to symbolize their kisses on paper. The "x" is the usual form employed, and is more definite and unmistakable than the "o's" which some of the lovelorn use. All hieroglyphics, however, are resorted to, and, in this wise detectives gain many a clew which might otherwise remain undiscovered. Love, like nature, "speakes a varied language," but there is an element of rashness in some of Cupid's epistolary records which frequently leads ardent writers into court. Kisses are best placed as nature intended them to be. On paper they often leave an unsavory mark; to the lips they can only leave their imprint on the heart.

February 9, 1922 ST. PAUL PIONEER-PRESS That Jazz Funeral

Is everything connected with the motion picture industry so light and frivolous that even the funeral service for William D. Taylor in a church was looked upon as an entertainment? Nothing more scandalous could be imagined than the state of mind of the throng that milled about the house of worship, heedless of interrupting the reverential ceremony with shouting and laughing, pushing and shoving for a chance to get a better view. Even the presence of death could not take away the levity with which that great amusement business is associated because of the Arbuckle case, the Pickford and Chaplin divorces and other revelations of life in the movie colonies. The movie people have brought that contempt upon themselves. The usefulness of many members of that industry and the prosperity of the industry itself will be ruined, if the public gets the idea that conditions behind the scenes are as bad as they are painted and are growing worse. The movie magnates cannot afford to forget that most of their patrons are decent and respectable men, women and children.

February 9, 1922 HONOLULU ADVERTISER The Latest Movie Scandal

When the Arbuckle scandal with all its sickening details was given front page position for several weeks, the movie world, it was then believed, was in for a thorough cleansing. People prominent in the motion picture industry were loud in their denunciation, not only of what Arbuckle was alleged to have done, but of the whole kit and caboodle of screen people whose idea of life seems to be predicated upon having what is more commonly known as "a good time" and not caring a whoop in hades how far they go in their efforts to obtain it. The press of the whole country recounted incident after incident to show that such occurrences as the one that made Arbuckle the defendant on a manslaughter charge, had taken place in the movie colonies time and again, and that certain New York hotels had reeked with such performances put on by motion picture actors and actresses. And now comes another scandal in the movie world. William D. Taylor, one of the most prominent men connected with America's fourth greatest industry, is found dead, and when the police investigation begins to show that the man's death might have been the result of certain unsavory matters, powerful interests of the motion picture world endeavor to direct the inquiry into certain lines to prevent an extension of the investigation in other directions. The motion picture world is just as badly in need of cleansing as it was when the Arbuckle scandal broke. There is something rotten that must be cut out of the industry, or the business is going to get into worse repute than it is now. Maybe Will Hays' connection with the industry will have some effect on it. Hays cannot--and will not--allow his name to be identified with an industry that is so honeycombed with filth as the motion picture business has been shown to be. The public is not going to continue to patronize the movies if it has to be made to look upon the faces and the antics of men and women whose private lives are known to be what revelations of the last several months have shown. It is all well enough for the public to cry out against the lurid "serials" which are said by some to be the cause of youthful depravity. But how about the big "feature" films in which appear screen people whose names carry odium?

February 9, 1922 ALBANY HERALD A Movie Housecleaning Needed

The motion picture industry must have a thorough housecleaning, started from within, if it is to save itself from the destructive effect of added scandal such as the Arbuckle and Taylor cases. A few more such nasty messes served up to the public will disgust decent-minded people to the extent that the producers and exhibitors will feel it where it will hurt them the most-- in the pocketbook. The trouble seems to be that there is, at the very source of motion- picture supply, a distorted and twisted moral sense that weaves its sinuous, sensual way throughout almost the entire industry. We do see some clean, moral pictures, it is true, but they are the exception rather than the rule. Some time ago it was announced with a great fanfare of trumpets that the motion picture magnates, or at least a controlling element among them, had come to the decision to eliminate the "sex stuff" from the motion picture world, realizing that it was in a fair way to tear down the industry. The announcement was hailed with delight by clean-minded movie fans. But little difference has been seen in the average run of pictures since that momentous "decision" was made. There has been much lament among women's club organizations, church bodies and similar circles, because of the lowered moral tone of the present generation. Immodesty in dress, cigarette-smoking and whiskey-drinking among women, loose actions and looser talk among the younger people of both sexes-- in fact, the entire trend of life among so-called "smart society," as well as its imitators, are some of the signs of the times. There is no doubt that the motion picture has had much to do with this lowered moral tone. It is impossible for young men and women, boys and girls of the impressionable age, to go night after night to the movies and see these things enacted on the screen, without having their moral sense perverted. Immodest, free-and-easy, devil-may-care, actually immoral scenes are shown in such matter-of-fact manner that youth of the adolescent age cannot fail to take away a corresponding outlook on life. And as to the effect on the actors themselves, who daily have to act these scenes, is it surprising that they, too, showed have a lowered moral standard? As long as motion picture actors and actresses have to play up the animal passions and the immoral lives that are so often featured on the screen, there should be no surprise when the Arbuckle and Taylor scandals arise to cast a damning shadow on the entire industry. If the motion picture world wants to save itself from disaster, it must have a housecleaning, beginning at the center and extending to the circumference--a housecleaning that will take in the cellar and garret, and all floors between.

February 10, 1922 CLEVELAND PRESS Hush

Motion picture interests are much aroused over the Taylor murder. Those who have money invested see in this latest Hollywood scandal the prospect of losing large sums. New York is therefore heard from, and we suddenly swerve from talk of a million-dollar reward to the soft-pedal, the hush-hush. What's a small thing like a murder when a lot of money is involved? As a matter of fact--looking at it from a purely cold-blooded business point of view--what should be done is first to exert every power possible toward clearing up the mystery, and then to conduct a wholesale firing of everyone in Hollywood whose personal life can't bear up under the test of common decency. The theory that the industry depends on the star is bunk. With every actress and actor of easy virtue canned, with a moral standard set up and inexorably enforced, there would within a year be produced an entirely new set of players who through proper training could quickly win their way to the hearts of the movie fan. The season of the pink nightie and the shot-in-the-arm has passed.

February 11, 1922 CHATTANOGA NEWS A Number of Things

The scandals of Hollywood have been renewed. It seems such a pity that the moving picture, which has within its powers the most graphic reproduction of life in the calendar of the arts, must be smirched with loose lives and low morals. The occurrences in which "Fatty" Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Mary Miles Minter and other stars have been involved, seem to us a very definite reflection of loose-moraled films, which gloss over vice for the gratification of the lower instincts. The concomitant of the seductive sex picture is an inevitable reaction on the character of the people engaged in their making. Will Hays has a big job on his hands. If he really wishes to purify the movies, he has plenty to do. Let him change the character of films--remove sex for sex' sake. The finest stories in the world are clean and intensely interesting. We had rather read Charles Dickens or Alfred Tennyson than Guy de Maupassant or Boccacio. Life in Hollywood fits Macbeth's description of his own career, "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."

February 11, 1922 SALT LAKE TELEGRAM Pot Calling Kettle Black

With each succeeding day producing new gossip concerning life in California's film colony, it is to be hoped that the Taylor murder mystery, which has baffled the coast police for a week, will soon be solved. The speculation and gossip which goes with the effort to solve the mystery is bad for California and the motion picture industry for the reason that it is general and not confined to the specific issues of the case. A solution of the mystery is necessary to clear the air and to separate the true from the false. Unfortunately the whole motion picture colony is under investigation for something which concerns only a few members of the profession. The East has raised its voice in shocked tones in an effort to move the industry from California to New York, as if a mere shifting of location could change the prevailing morals. And when it comes to morals are we to judge the entire profession by the individual acts of the few? We know that the industry includes big men and pure women and we do not think we are far wrong when we say that the greater part of the colony is comprised of these people. Even if they were not, we could hardly change the morals by moving the industry eastward. Moral cleansings must come from within and a complete change would necessitate beginning all over again. Still we do not admit that the morals of the film people are worse than those in other walks of life. In the case at issue we have heard brokers and business men mentioned, but no long haired reformer has risen to cry out for a moral cleansing of the business world. The fact of the matter is that questionable morals creep into every walk of life. They seldom prevail, as a general rule, but isolated cases of immorality may be attached to every art and every profession known to our people Film stars are essentially public idols. They are constantly before the gaze of the people. They are known by name and face to more people than any other class. For this reason their actions are subject to closer scrutiny than those of people who are not so widely known. No doubt this is the reason why the occasional sins of members of the profession claim nationwide attention, when the same deeds would go practically unnoticed in another walk of life. Judgment of the film colony should not be based on what any individual member of it has done. A solution of the Taylor mystery will help to remove many of the libels which have been attached to the profession by gossip and speculation, and before we move the industry to New York, let us have some assurance that the metropolis is free of the things it condemns in California.

February 11, 1922 SANTA BARBARA PRESS Be Fair to Movie Folks

Of hundreds of thousands of men and women engaged in the moving picture industry some are characterless, immoral, and unspeakably bad. Because success in their business depends in large measure on the popularity of producers, directors and actors, unusual efforts have been made to bring and keep their names before the public. Keenest publicity men, who know and practice every trick of the trade, make the most of any incident the publication of which may add luster to the particular star in whose interest they are employed. Amongst no other class is there so much personal advertising. Everybody knows the leaders and there is a peculiar interest in all persons associated with the movies. Whatever they do, everything that befalls them, because the movie folks have been so much advertised and are so well known, has a "news value" entirely out of proportion with the real significance of the incident. Whether what they have done is good or bad-- and particularly if bad--a public interest or curiosity is aroused which the newspapers feel bound to recognize. What might happen in another circle and arouse nothing more than a morning's gossip over neighborhood back fences, if the principals happen to be of the movies receives front page space in the newspapers of two or three continents. It becomes a subject of world interest. Therefore so much scandal from Hollywood, the world's movie capital. Almost daily we read about some movie queen or film hero having done something which ought not have been done, until we begin to believe the life of all of them consists in such acts. And we condemn the entire hundreds of thousands because of the deeds of the few. There are bad ones amongst the movie folks. But there are many who are not bad--and surely some who are good. It is futile to condemn a class or sect or nationality or race. Many families have their black sheep. Churches often are forced to deal with hypocrites. But we do not condemn the whole because of the faults of one or a few. Let us be as fair with the movie folks. "Fatty" Arbuckle is no more representative of the morals of the movie profession than Arthur Burch is of real estate dealers. William Desmond Taylor was not the first man whose death revealed the secret of a double life. Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were not the first couple whose marriage might not have been legally solemnized but for Nevada divorce courts. Let us think of the thousands working in the movies whose lives are possibly all that we would wish our own to be--innocent and wholesomely honest--and have consideration for them. And a little charity to the others may win reward as a Christian virtue.

February 12, 1922 MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL Hollywood and Modern Paganism

Two tragedies in the moving picture world during the past few months have brought about a revelation of moral conditions of paleolithic primitiveness in that habitat of mimicry and misapplied mirth. Workaday people have stood aghast at the stories of Sybaritic indulgence and Paphian license in the lives of some of these heroes and heroines of the screen. What has been told in the daily press is all the more shocking because it concerns the persons of those who have been the idols of millions of their countrymen. The disillusionment thus brought about has been almost as depressing as has been the shock to moral sensibilities. From many mouths that once came paeans of praise and admiration now come bitter and contemptuous execrations. Right now almost everybody who is anybody, and some who are not are giving voice to theories as to why conditions should be as they are in this moving picture colony, and nearly as many are suggesting remedies both drastic and merciful. Unaccustomed wealth and the opportunity it offers for self-indulgence, coupled with lack of knowledge in some of its new found possessors as to the better things it could procure, have made it a curse rather than a benefit. Creating sensations in crimes of sex and violence, some of the screen stars have sought sensations of the same sort. Evil feeds upon evil until the appetite for normal pleasure and happiness becomes vitiated and tasteless. Decensus averni facilis. Yea, verily, is this the tragedy of bad beginnings. But bad beginnings are a thing for which blame may be placed on others than the victims, and we say this in no sense of extenuation. Defenders of this modern Paphos of the Pacific Coast insist that life there is no worse than it is in other communities of inordinate wealth and idle luxury, and they are to a certain extent right. But even so, they offer in this apology neither justification nor mitigating circumstance. It is true that among too many of the newly rich whose minds have not been seasoned by acquaintance with the best thoughts, or whose mental processes have not been fortified by the logic of the highest philosophy, there have grown up cults and coteries of new thought and ultra modern sentiment. With wealth has come a desire for seeming refinement, and the short cuts that have been taken towards a specious culture have led to the abodes of dilettante poetasters and parlor philosophasters. There novelty has been enshrined over truth, and the quest for what is new by the strange paradox of ignorance is leading back to most primitive and barbaric thought. The great trouble with certain mercenary motion picture producers is that they either have been poisoned with this supposedly new thought or else have been capitalizing it for their financial profit. They have gotten together companies of actors, some of whom have had no higher view of life than could be obtained by associations between the midnight and the dawn. They, too, in the belief that familiarity with this modern rot meant culture, have made fetiches of individual assertiveness and sexual predominance. And in this connection we are much impressed with the fact that the book brought back to the slain picture director by the young woman actress, whose name has been mentioned in the case, was a volume of Freud. Right now this German exponent of subconscious and unconscious thought and sexual omnipotence is the fad of all modern novelty seekers, and we are not in the least surprised at his currency in Hollywood. But Freud should not carry the whole blame for all the faddist cults of pale minds and prurient desires. With his psycho analysis resting heavily upon sex stimulation this new high priest of the psychic world came at a time when appetites for pornographic nourishment had become dull and jaded. A long line of caterers to such vicious tastes had preceded him, and he merely gave a new stimulation to a tired sense. French novelists before and after Gautier had made of sex and end and aim of existence, and they had done so in ways that were insidiously fascinating and attractive. The same purpose inspired the school of blatant new thought in Germany and Scandinavia, although its leaders were much more direct and much more brutally frank. Haputmann and Sudermann looked into the dark and decaying corners of the world with distinctive Teutonic eyes and they set their followers to thinking in terms of social unrest and revolt. Ibsen came as the liberator for those who idly regarded the most sacred obligations of marriage, home and social duties. For a time this Norwegian dramatist was on the lips of all the faddists and dilettante philosophers. He brought a message of hope to those who could conceive nothing higher in life than their own conveniences and the gratification of their own pleasure. In Russia, Tolstoi, for all of his wonderful talents; Dostoievsky, in a less potent way, became voices of protest against conventions and usages that, even considering their errors and imperfections, had made for the moral progress of the world. In our own country Walt Whitman and, to a lesser extent because less known, some of our novelists and playwrights have sought to throw off restraint and assert their view of individual omnipotence. And over in England George Bernard Shaw with a facile and ready pen has been inveighing against almost everything that is merely because it is and appealing for all this is not merely because it is not. For the majority of these social revolutionists and moral anarchists the impelling thought has seemed to be to shock their way into recognition. They have gained audiences and a following chiefly because it has been thought that it was smart to be identified with some ism or some movement to rearrange the world in any manner so that it differed from the prevailing mode. And it has been to audiences of this sort rather than to sound and healthy minded people that the picture purveyors have mostly catered. In the matter of sex the modern love cults and free thought exponents have turned their faces back to pagan days, when phallic worship was enshrined. Hired at enormous salaries both to minister to and to live in this pagan spirit what wonder then that many of these motion picture actors and actresses, some of whom are but half literate, have shocked the moral sensibilities of the nation? Would it not have been a miracle had it been otherwise? So that, while pouring hot words of wrath or sneering expressions of scorn upon these unfortunate victims of an ill good fortune, let us ask ourselves if the nation itself, or, at least, a part of it, does not bear some responsibility for what is now being revealed. We seek not to exonerate nor even to extenuate Hollywood by saying that it is the terrible but logical result of all the so called new thought that has poisoned the minds of too many others outside of its precincts. Who can deny that Hollywood is an effect rather than a cause of the modern paganism that thinks of itself as being a new morality?

February 13, 1922 MEMPHIS NEWS-SCIMITAR The Intimate Image

The public will have but slight sympathy for the film stars implicated in California's recent scandal in the metropolis of the motion picture world. They are not entitled to sympathy. It is amazing that persons who have spent years in bringing themselves prominently before the public, making their names and faces household words wherever the motion picture is patronized, should feel so slight a responsibility to the patrons who have made their success possible. It is amazing that they should feel so slight a responsibility to their co-workers in the industry--those who have sought to preserve their reputations clean and their names above reproach. The frequency with which such episodes occur is convincing evidence that there must be a reformation in the motion picture industry. The public does not fail to associate the reputation of the actor with the character that the actor portrays. Since it is the business of the actors to secure as much publicity as possible, it is not only necessary but imperative that their lives and daily conduct shall be in accord with the life one finds in the average American home. The motion picture is a very intimate thing. It has been developed to such an extent that the audience is made to feel the physical presence of the actors on the screen. This feeling has been made possible by the development of the mechanics of the business, and the lesson that the actor must learn is that people will not patronize the image if the individual in reality is one whom they would not desire to associate with in actual life.

February 13, 1922 SANTA ANA REGISTER Should Order a Clean-Up

The moving picture people are again on the defensive. Again? No--yet. For it has been months since they have been in a position to feel at ease concerning the public's attitude toward them. One need not recount the various scandals that have kept the moving picture people on the defensive. For years much of the public's criticism was launched at the character of films produced; not it is launched at the character of moving picture actors. And the public has a right to demand that the lives of moving picture stars be clean. Of course, the same demand is a legitimate demand upon the personnel of any group of people in the public eye. But particularly is it true that moving picture producers and all of those whose names become by- words in the families of the country should be men and women of good moral character. It is important to the movie industry for the reason that children, as well as others, idealize the stars of the screen. Let the star fall, and the ideal is shattered, and no man or woman can estimate the damage that can be done in such a crash. If we may judge the temper of the American people today, those who invest large sums of money in movie production stand a risk of loss unless in making their contracts the producers take into consideration the moral standing of the stars. In the period through which the screen industry is going at this time, the men and women who are engaged in it and whose manner of living may be above reproach, have to suffer. There is nothing unusual about that; in this life it is the common thing that the innocent suffer with the guilty. In this instance, the duty of the innocent is to show no mercy for the guilty. Public officials in Los Angeles are hinting that powerful interests in the movie world have ordered that mouths be closed lest the disclosures in the investigations into the murder of William Desmond Taylor bring additional discredit upon the movie industry. The order should be for a complete clean- up, and until there is a complete clean-up, until the heads of the industry set adrift all moral derelicts who may be connected with the industry, the movie colonies can expect to be looked upon with suspicion and without sympathy.

February 14, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Persecuting the Movies

Lacking real clews to explain the mystery of the murder of William Desmond Taylor, the motion-picture director, public curiosity has turned ravenously upon the private affairs of the movie actors. Not only have the innermost facts of the life of the murdered man been thrown to the winds, but every young girl who knew Taylor by sight seems to be considered legitimate prey. Private papers found in the apartments of the murdered man have been shouted from the housetops. With a bloodhound ferocity the pack-and-cry is in full pursuit of every stain in the life of everyone connected with the motion-picture industry. It seems cruel and unnecessary that the letters of young girls should be ruthlessly flung to the world to read for no other reason than the slim excuse that they were found in the house of the murdered man. There is no pretense on the part of anyone that these missives have any possible bearing upon the murder mystery. That some very young girl in the glow of a romance should write, "I love you; I love you; I love you," to a man old enough to be her father is no very terrible indictment. In any event, there is no reason why she should be exposed to scorn, ridicule and disgrace--just because the man to whom they were addressed happened to fall a victim to an assassin's bullet. Not only have these letters been pitilessly and mercilessly displayed to the public; but some of them have been printed in such a way as to leave the most vicious possible inferences. Against these nasty inferences the young girls in question have no defense. It is, for them, a case of "Be damned if you do; be damned if you don't." The only possible explanation they could make would be to lay still barer their innermost private secrets. In the opinion of The Times the public has no right to any papers or letters in this or any other case that does not have a direct and official connection with the untanglement of this mystery; unless they would, for instance, be considered proper evidence in a murder case on trial. The doctrine that every private letter and every secret of every kind found in a house where a crime has been committed should be published is a dangerous one. There are few who have not written letters, who have not, in fact, had experiences that they would shrink from seeing on the public billboards. The fact that the girl writers of the letters happen, in this case, to have been young, beautiful and world-famous does not take away their rights. Their fault was to fail to recognize that persons in the public eye must suffer from restrictions as to their conduct in private life which are not imposed upon individuals "to fame and fortune unknown." The Times is not impelled to protest against the procedure in this instance because those concerned happen to be connected with one of our most important industries. It is not a question of economics or business, but one of common justice. The Times has always refused to suppress news. The public is entitled to know the legitimate and relevant facts about this and all other matters of genuine public interest, even though these facts cause discomfort. But The Times does contend that to drag the bottom of the sea for every shred and putrid remnant of gossip and scandal affecting every person who had a speaking acquaintance with a murdered man is unjust, outrageous, unsafe, unethical, ungenerous--and mighty bad business.

February 15, 1922 CHARLESTON NEWS AND COURIER Hollywood and Mr. Bryan

What will be the effect upon the movie industry of recent events in the movie world continues to be an interesting subject for speculation. Various opinions are being expressed, but the general idea seems to be that the public will continue to worship its screen idols just as fervently as before and perhaps a little more fervently, if that be possible. Nevertheless, we note that in New York the other day mention of Mary Pickford's name brought a volley of hisses. Hence it appears that there are some people who are not as kindly disposed towards Miss Pickford as they were some time ago. It is rather interesting, too, to observe that a big newspaper, which used to issue every Sunday a movie magazine devoted mainly to pictures of movie stars, has now abandoned this supplement and is being commended by man of its readers for its action. To jump from discussion of these matters to Mr. William Jennings Bryan may seem queer and illogical, but it isn't. The things that are now coming out about the movies contribute to a movement which is surely taking form in this country and in which Mr. Bryan is certainly interested because he is its natural and logical head--a great reform movement aimed against the looseness of these times, against jazz, modern dances, liquor, lack of Sunday observance, Hollywood, scantily clad chorus girls, cabarets, sex plays, agnosticism, Stillman cases, etc., etc. Some may think it almost incredible that in this sort of thing there is the making of a first class political issue, but stranger things have happened. There were not many people a decade ago who were ready to believe that national prohibition was just around the corner.

February 15, 1922 FRESNO REPUBLICAN Feminism or Logic?

Another example of confused logic in dealing with public affairs is that in an Eastern women's gathering reported yesterday. Club women refused to support a resolution to censor motion pictures that contain the photographs of Mabel Normand or Mary Miles Minter. This line of attack on the pictures might have carried had it not been for the brand of feminism that was injected into the discussion. The resolution was defeated because, it was declared, not Miss Normand or Miss Minter were responsible for the character of the pictures nor of the movie colony life now under discussion, but the managers and directors of the pictures. Possibly true, and yet what of it? If the medium through which we know of the bad movie life and the medium through which we are shown objectionable photo drama are the pictures of women whose lives have been involved in notorious incidents, are not the treatment of these pictures of these women the proper and the sole means of dealing with these unknown directors and managers? What are the face and form of Mabel Normand but a lay figure upon which the work of the director is hung? If Mary Miles Minter is a responsible part of a photodrama, then boycott of the picture may properly punish her. If she is an irresponsible part of the picture, will the boycott of the picture injure her any? It is a question of emphasis. To women who think that feminism is the issue, any criticism of any woman in the world is an error to be fought. But if right and wrong, or good or bad policy is the issue, then men and women, irrespective of sex, must be dealt with as factors in this complicated system of rights and wrongs that we must work with. We don't believe in official censorship of movies. We do believe in unofficial, popular censorship of them. But any censorship, should be sensible censorship.

February 16, 1922 RUTLAND HERALD The Films and the Murder

The newspapers which connected the names of Mary Miles Minter and Mabel Normand with the recent mysterious death of William Desmond Taylor may be responsible for the almost immediate decline of popularity in films with which these women's names are connected, but they are merely responsible for uttering the facts, not for the facts themselves. The public does its own censoring more or less, but, after all, is there any reason why the Normand and Minter films should be barred from the screen as was done in Lynn recently? No stretch of supposition has so far set up any personal connection between the director's death and these actresses. No trial has been held. It would seem at least fair to wait until there are some definite facts to go on before their productions are blacklisted or boycotted. Also, some of the newspapers rather overdid the Arbuckle business-- without much evidential fact to go on. The mistake ought not to be repeated.

February 17, 1922 CHICAGO TRIBUNE Cleaning up Movie-Land

Vested interests in existing reputations naturally are resisting publicity in the Hollywood affair. Various pundits of the movie world are busily explaining that virtue reigns supreme there and meanwhile we have an exhibition of official confusion and helplessness in the investigation of the Taylor murder which speaks volumes. The authorities are like babes in the forest of rumor which sprang up so suddenly when Taylor was found dead in the heart of the great movie colony. In the hubbub, the most conspicuous of the suspects, Sands, seems to have disappeared as completely as if he were evaporated. No one knows anything of any value about Taylor and his friends whom everyone knew. It is the sort of situation which starts a detective story auspiciously, but it is doing the movie profession and industry no good. We should recommend less protesting of virtue and innocence and more candid confession of conditions which call for strong treatment. The trial of an individual or individuals for the murder of Taylor might be costly to profit making reputations, but it would help clean house and in the long run it would enable the industry or profession to get out of the quicksand of vice and lawlessness, to a firm footing on hard work and clean living. Other and better founded popularities could be built up and such mishaps as have occurred in recent years among the favorites of the screen could be diminished or avoided. Conditions revealed at Hollywood are impossible for any profession to survive and the quicker they are expelled from the world of moving picture art the better for all concerned. Bitter medicine will have to be taken, but it will have to take it.

February 18, 1922 SAN FRANCISCO JOURNAL A Public Duty

Upon District Attorney Woolwine of Los Angeles rests a heavy responsibility. Practically speaking, the fate of the moving picture industry of the South is in his hands. If it is to live, it must be purged of its immoral element, and with the district attorney rests the burden of the legal end of the task. The good people of America are aroused to demand a day of better things. They have opened the doors of their lives to this attractive form of entertainment, but they demand protection from the evil thoughts that are daily spread before their children. It is not the job of the district attorney to censor the films, but it is his job to run down the crime that has flourished like the deadly Upas tree. He should know the influences he has to fight in unearthing crime, and he should make the public acquainted with them. If there be a conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice, he should ferret it out and exterminate it. Upon the unflinching performance of the prosecutor's duty rests the only hope of clearing up the Taylor murder mystery, and upon that contingency rests the prospect of setting the movie house in order. No greater calamity could befall its real best interests than to leave this thing undone. The public will be satisfied with nothing less than thorough housecleaning. When producers find out that it does not pay to flout public opinion, they will quit doing it. When stars pass into sudden eclipse upon the breaking of scandal or crime over them, the hazard of having huge sums of money tied up in their discredited films will give the producers a strong incentive to cultivate a line of talent that can be depended upon not to spoil their futures by unseemly conduct. The safest way for the producers to avoid a tyrannical censorship is to produce films that do not need a censor.

February 26, 1922 TACOMA LEDGER Gets Cocktails too Easily

"Los Angeles gets its cocktails too easily and it has too many producers who think that the evil things in their minds were implanted by public demand. These two influences have worked havoc with scores of fine young people who have invaded the kaleidoscopic realm of many marvels," says an observer in commenting upon the Hollywood scandals which have lately attracted the attention of the country. It is not a good thing for any person to "get his cocktails too easily." In other words, it is not usually well for the average person to be able to obtain even the good things of life without a considerable effort, for unless one has worked for that which he has, he neither can appreciate it to the fullest measure, nor can he very often use it well. Possession of great wealth may be a blessing or a curse, just what we make of it. Wealth, when regarded as a trust involving obligations to society, may be, and usually is, of most benefit to humanity. Wealth which has come easily and which is regarded solely as a means for the gratification of personal desires is a curse both to society and to the individual into whose hands it has fallen. It has well been said that the unfortunate occurrences which have brought some moving picture stars and those connected therewith under a cloud have been due to the sudden acquisition of money upon the part of those who do not know what to do with it. It can also be said with equal truth that such a state of affairs is by no means confined to moving picture folk. the pranks of the idle rich have long amused sober-minded people, and the antics of some members of the so-called "smart set" have aroused the indignation of right-thinking persons. There is a difference between the wealth employed in establishing foundations for the study of disease, or for the advancement of education, and wealth employed to seek out a new sensation through "hop parties," "moonshine orgies" or the utter senselessness of "monkey parties." It is not well for humanity that it shall "get its cocktails too easily."
