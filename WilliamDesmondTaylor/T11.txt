***************************************************************************** What is TAYLOROLOGY? TAYLOROLOGY is a newsletter focusing on the life and death of William Desmond Taylor, a top Paramount film director in early Hollywood who was shot to death on February 1, 1922. His unsolved murder was one of Hollywood's major scandals. This newsletter will deal with: (a) The facts of Taylor's life; (b) The facts and rumors of Taylor's murder; (c) The impact of the Taylor murder on Hollywood and the nation. Primary emphasis will be given toward reprinting, referencing and analyzing source material, and sifting it for accuracy.

***************************************************************************** "Hollywood Mysteries"--Shredded

As stated in TAYLOROLOGY 4, most published recaps of the Taylor murder case (in newspapers, magazines, books, and "crime encyclopedias") are filled with errors and inaccuracies. The following is a recent typical example. HOLLYWOOD MYSTERIES is a small book published by Globe Publishing in 1989, containing a short 5-page recap of the Taylor case. Included in just those five pages are various unsubstantiated (and probably false) rumors: that Taylor was a "notorious womanizer," that Mary Miles Minter "and her mother had been taking turns in Taylor's bed," that "an autographed pair of Mary's panties was found by police in Taylor's closet," that Taylor "had opium and cocaine habits," that Taylor had "a closet full of bras and lingerie," that "police found pornographic photographs of Taylor posing with some of the biggest female stars in Hollywood," that Charlotte Shelby "was also known to spend a night or two over at Taylor's bungalow," etc. Rational arguments can be presented against all of those unverified rumors. But rumors aside, that recap in HOLLYWOOD MYSTERIES includes many "facts" which are certainly absolutely false:

It is stated that Taylor was the president of the Screen Director's Guild. FACT: Taylor was president of the Los Angeles branch of the Motion Picture Director's Association (MPDA), an entirely different organization. The Screen Director's Guild would not be founded until the 1930s. The MPDA was not a union, unlike the Screen Director's Guild, and the MPDA had a separate New York branch, with separate officers. At the time of Taylor's death, J. Searle Dawley was president of the New York branch.

It is stated that Taylor was shot twice through the heart. FACT: The coroner's report indicates that he was shot just once, in the left side, the bullet puncturing his left lung, but not his heart.

It is stated that Taylor's body was found with "a chair draped over his legs." FACT: A wooden chair was astride one leg, but it was not overturned.

It is stated that Edna Purviance telephoned Charlotte Shelby and told her Taylor had been killed. FACT: Purviance did not telephone Shelby; Shelby learned of Taylor's death from Carl Stockdale. (Edna Purviance telephoned Mabel Normand; Normand telephoned her director Dick Jones on the Sennett lot; word spread throughout the Sennett lot and reached Stockdale who was acting in a picture there; Stockdale called Shelby.)

It is stated that Charlotte Shelby called Charles Eyton and notified him that Taylor had been killed. FACT: Shelby did not notify Eyton. As Eyton testified at the inquest, he had been telephoned and notified by Harry Fellows, Taylor's assistant director.

It is stated that Mabel Normand and Adolph Zukor were at Taylor's bungalow on the morning the body was found. FACT: Mabel Normand did not return to Taylor's bungalow until three days after the murder; Adolph Zukor was in New York at the time and did not come to Los Angeles until more than a week after the murder.

It is stated that Charles Eyton arrived at the bungalow prior to the arrival of the police. FACT: As testimony at the inquest indicates, policemen Ziegler and Parsons were already on the scene before Eyton arrived there.

It is stated that the police were not notified of Taylor's death until an hour or so after the body had been discovered. FACT: The police were notified a few minutes after the body was found; Peavey discovered Taylor's body at 7:30 and the police arrived before 8:00.

It is stated that when the police arrived, Zukor and Eyton were burning Taylor's personal papers in his fireplace. FACT: Taylor's bungalow had no fireplace.

It is stated that Mary Miles Minter was one of the chief suspects in Taylor's murder. FACT: The police never suspected Minter of having murdered Taylor.

It is stated that Minter attended Taylor's funeral, approached the casket, and started screaming that the corpse had spoken to her. FACT: Minter did not attend Taylor's funeral; she went into seclusion a few days after the murder and did not emerge in public for over a month. At the same time the funeral was in progress, she was making an official statement to William Doran of the district attorney's office. The "talking corpse" episode took place several days prior to the funeral, and she did not start screaming (see below).

It is stated that Mary Miles Minter spent several hours in Taylor's bungalow on the day of the murder, prior to Mabel Normand's visit. FACT: Minter certainly did not visit Taylor's bungalow that day prior to Mabel Normand. If Minter did visit Taylor's bungalow after Normand, it was only for a few minutes.

It is stated that Mabel Normand visited Taylor for several hours on the day of the murder. FACT: Her visit only lasted about 45 minutes, from 7:00 to 7:45 p.m.

It is stated that police wanted to investigate Shelby but that she "bolted to Europe." FACT: Shelby did not go to Europe until mid-1926, more than four years after the murder.

It is stated that Zelda Crosby was "a Taylor lover who killed herself because of his infidelities." FACT: Zelda Crosby committed suicide in New York; Taylor worked in Los Angeles. It is very doubtful that Taylor and Crosby even knew each other.

The Taylor case is one of the most fascinating murder cases in American history. It is regrettable that most of the material written about the case has focused on spreading silly rumors and misinformation, rather than delving into the real facts of the case.

Confessions, Confessions

February 16, 1922 NEW YORK HERALD (Los Angeles)--No end of letters from cranks are pouring into the investigative offices. Police Captain Adams says it beats anything in his nineteen years' experience. He has time to read only a few of them. One writes from Oregon that he did it, and adds, "I am leaving Portland tonight, but whether north, south, east or west I don't say. Come and find me." All these letters are being studied on the chance that one of them might yield pay dirt, but thus far they have proved merely vexations and time wasting.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 27, 1922 ST LOUIS STAR The district attorney of Los Angeles will have to have some rejection slips printed soon to use in returning confessions in the Taylor case.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 7, 1922 TULSA TRIBUNE Why can't all those persons who have confessed to the Taylor murder get together and draw straws to determine who's going to be "it"?
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 7, 1922 DES MOINES TRIBUNE Los Angeles sleuths report that they have had over a hundred letters "confessing" the murder of Movie Director Taylor. And no doubt most of the writers are peeved because their letters didn't even get into the newspapers.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 8, 1922 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE Curdled Brains More than 300 different persons have written to the Los Angeles police "confessing" to the murder of William Taylor. This means that there are at least 300 weak-minded individuals in the country. One can hardly think of a feebler brain than the one that spends time and trouble to pretend the conception of a crime it knows nothing of except through the papers. But, after all, this is nothing to the exhibition of mental debility we would have if Taylor's murderer were behind the bars. The unsolved mystery of the crime has brought forward only one type of imbeciles. Another and far larger class would be produced by the capture of the criminal. Were his address known at some prominent jail thirty times 300 addlepates would proclaim themselves by sending him flowers, writing him scented notes full of silly slush, and trying to call on him in order to bring their morbid sentimentality into contact with his aura of iniquity. No, the Taylor mystery has by no means revealed all the whey wits in the country. The possibilities are not at all exhausted in the count of 300. And from that point of view we have really been lucky that the murderer has not been caught.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 7, 1922 LOUISVILLE TIMES If there were a conspiracy to destroy public interest in the solution of the mystery surrounding the murder of William Desmond Taylor, it could not find more effective means than to present a confession a day from here, there and somewhere else. The public interest is certain to grow less as the numerous admissions of guilt prove to be false.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 8, 1922 LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL Hang Them All Never a day passes that does not bring new confessions of the murder of Taylor, the Hollywood moving picture director. A Los Angeles dispatch says that more than 300 persons in the United States, with one in England and one in France, have now "confessed" they killed Taylor, though with one exception none of them has signed his name to the confession. Would it not be well to take these persons at their word? Would it not be more than worth while for the detectives to run down these 300 confessed murderers, round them up at some central spot and hang the whole bunch? They have confessed that they deserve hanging; their actions prove it; and they ought to get their deserts.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 12, 1922 OAKLAND TRIBUNE In the frost-bitten states of the East more than three hundred persons have confessed that they murdered Taylor. There can be but one reason and it is strange Los Angeles has not realized the significance. What those three hundred persons wish is the chance to be warmed on the famous Los Angeles police grill.

***************************************************************************** The Public Speaks

February 10, 1922 NEW YORK NEWS The Inquiring Photographer THE QUESTION. Do you think a man or a woman murdered Taylor? THE ANSWERS. C. A. Cruise, cotton broker: "I think a woman murdered him. My experience and observations have shown me that a woman will do anything for revenge when she thinks she has been jilted. Some woman probably was insanely jealous." Mrs. E. W. Cunningham, housewife: "A man shot him. I base my opinion on the manner in which Taylor was murdered. It was so cleverly concealed that it must be the work of some man. A woman isn't so clever in such affairs." Arthur Schwartz, college student: "I think a man did the shooting, because a woman would never shoot a man in the back. She is too eager to see the expression of pain. And she feels that a jury will exonerate her anyway." Mrs. Tessie Saeger, housewife: "My intuition tells me that a woman fired the fatal shot. He had so many affairs that one of the women was bound to 'get him in the long run.' Once a woman gives her all, it isn't so easy to get rid of her. Dr. A. J. Lippman, dentist: "From the newspaper accounts it is impossible to form a definite opinion. Reporters now have a splendid opportunity to exercise their dramatic powers. But, of course, a woman was the cause."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 11, 1922 Ruth West NEW YORK WORLD (letter to the editor) Why can't some of the money spent for booze reform and foreign missions be used to clean up Hollywood? Why isn't something done to stop the scandalous doings in that place? Why are these people allowed to have their own code of morals and law?
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 13, 1922 H. G. Meyer OMAHA BEE (letter to the editor) No one takes pleasure in accusing a dead man, who cannot defend himself before earthly accusers; nevertheless, lovers of decency fail to understand why anyone should want to defend William D. Taylor, the latest murder victim, and describe him as an "hitherto highly respected citizen." Enough has come to light to prove that if he enjoyed the respect of decent people, he was not worthy of it. Some may not be certain whether this is a case of a good man gone bad or a bad man found out. Usually character and habits are fully formed before middle age and it is not likely that this man Taylor was an exception. If he had always lived a clean, respectable life he would hardly have become the moral degenerate that his actions and mode of life, as now revealed, indicate. Since it has become known that in their social life many of the leading stars are flagrant violators of the laws of God and man, living in vice and debauchery, it is time that respectable people should turn their backs upon them and protect themselves from pollution. All citizens should obey the laws, including the 18th Amendment, and when they refuse to do so, let them be punished.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 10, 1922 "Movie" CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER (letter to the editor) Movie stars should be compelled to get certificates of ordinary good character before being permitted to appear on the screen.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 20, 1922 L. L. Child BALTIMORE AMERICAN (letter to the editor) So much has been said of the Minter pictures being barred, that as one of her many admirers and a firm believer in her character, I would like to know the meaning of the words Christianity and Justice! Mary Miles Minter is but a kid, despite her years before the public, and because of the unkindness of fate in throwing her into the way of a man more than twice her age and with much experience with women, because of a little gush note she is to be deprived of her livelihood. Instead of helping her regain her footing on the ladder of life, she is told to "Slide, Kelly, slide" strait to the devil; and if she doesn't go fast enough, they'll give her a boost down the chute. Then they'll go to church, singing "Hozanna," and praise God they are not as other men are, and for once they'll be right, for they are worse! Personally, I believe she is as straight and clean as the majority that walk the streets today.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 15, 1922 "Regular Reader" NEW ORLEANS ITEM (letter to the editor) Permit me to offer my humble protest against the uncalled for amount of publicity given the notorious doings of the movie stars. As the father of two daughters and a son, it causes me no little concern to know that my children are made conversant with the affairs of the demi-monde[3] through reading the newspapers. It is all well and good to say that such things are part of life, and that children should not be kept in ignorance, but the fact remains that such recitals as frequently appear regarding the picture people work injury upon the plastic mind of the young man or woman.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 22, 1922 R. D. Martin LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL (letter to the editor) Hollywood, the moving picture center of California, ever present in the news of late by reason of the shocking scandals of its dollar chasing, money- grafting bunch, is enough to make a dog sick.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 19, 1922 C. B. Reed BUFFALO EXPRESS (letter to the editor) Hollywood, it is apparent, can be relied upon to furnish quite regularly sufficient scandal to satisfy the most morbidly inclined of the readers of the daily press. What is the reason that a profession possessing so many possibilities for the betterment of mankind should degenerate to such a low estate morally?
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 19, 1922 W. H. Brashear LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL (letter to the editor) To what degree is the present abnormal prevalence of juvenile delinquency, together with the unusual "crime wave" in general, attributable directly and indirectly to the vicious scenario? There can be no reasonable doubt but what the movie screen, through its various forms of heroized criminality and its exhaltation of the salacious vampistic heroine is no small factor as an influence for crime and immorality. The revolting revelations of recent months of orgies indulged in by movie actors and actresses "high up" in the screen world would seem to indicate that these theatrical people are endeavoring to put in actual practice the logical significance of what they have indirectly preached through the screen. That they have descended personally to depravity is but a natural and inevitable consequence. For the purveyors of degradation naturally precede in infamy those whom they corrupt and are even the first to reach the limit of moral perdition. Theatrical screendom must be purged of the serpent's trail which, if not over it all, is yet over much of it; it must be taken wholly out of the hands of the sordid producer who would barter for gold the morals and decency of the people; it must cease to order films made in Sodom, Gomorrah or Hollywood.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 23, 1922 "Fair Play" OMAHA NEWS (letter to the editor) I have been amused reading the feeble defense of one of your correspondents relative to the so-called movie stars and their morals. The public is aware of the film folks' fun and are in need of no camouflaged explanations. What I cannot understand is why they persecute the unfortunate girl of the street and allow these legalized professionals to go scott free.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * January 27, 1923 George Sloan MOVIE WEEKLY (letter to the editor) Cut out the sloppy balderdash handed out by the press boys. Most movie fans are becoming very cynical concerning the powdered dimpled darlings who now "star" in the movies. A few have brains, but the raft of spineless sweeties whose press agents write their "Biorgraphies," and who drive up to a "rendouvoo" eating peanuts and reading the Police Gazette, who hold forth as the Queens of Hop at night and second-class "America's Sweethearts" in the daytime--all of these and this the movie public is good and sick of.


***************************************************************************** Epilogue: August 1923 August 9, 1923 LOS ANGELES EXPRESS Mother Calls Mary M. Minter "If I should die before I wake, and it would mean your redemption, I would gladly go." With this prayer thought for her estranged daughter, Mary Miles Minter, famous motion picture actress, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby entered that dream world of unconsciousness that is next thing to death. Mrs. Shelby underwent a major operation at Good Samaritan Hospital Tuesday morning of this week for abcesses of the liver and dangerous intestinal trouble. Mary Miles Minter has talked a lot about "liberty" since she left her mother's home, and refused to return. Death may help her attain that desired liberty, for Mrs. Shelby's vitality is so low that it is a question whether she recovers. Letter after letter Mrs. Shelby has written to her "baby girl" imploring her to return. "The vultures who have taken possession of your baser self will drag you down to oblivion," wrote Mrs. Shelby to her little "Juliette." (Mary's name is Juliette O'Reilly.) This typecal mother lies today at death's door, and cares not whether she recovers. Life is not worth living if Mary is lost to her.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 9, 1923 LOS ANGELES HERALD "Has she come?" Many times today Mrs. Charlotte Shelby roused herself on her bed of pain and asked the doctors and nurses that question, but each time they were forced to shake their heads negatively in sorrow, for her daughter, Mary Miles Minter, the film star, has not come to see her in the hospital. Miss Minter is in the Pasadena. Lying at the point of death, with a presentiment that she will not recover, Mrs. Shelby has implored a reconciliation with her daughter, but her pleas have continued to fall on deaf ears.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 10, 1923 LOS ANGELES TIMES Mary to Sue Her Mother Mary Miles Minter is Irish. She admits it and she looked it yesterday afternoon. Her big blue eyes blazed with wrath, then filmed with tears as she told her side of the story of the dissension in her household which brought about the estrangement with her mother and sister to the breaking point. "They never would let me be a girl, to have a girl's pleasures, to do the things that other girls would do," she said. "I was never even allowed to have for myself the little pleasures shown in roles I played in pictures. I never had a doll, except that I held one in the pictures. I never had one all of my own. I never had a chance to play tag, or hide-and-go-seek or have a kiddiecar. I was always petted and pampered, tutored and touted, made to believe I was something I was not, do things I did not want to do, say things I did not mean. From morning till night I had money, money, money, talked and preached to me. I have earned lots of it, fairly hate it and have none of it. "Mother is sick, quite sick, but she is not critically ill and has never asked for me," said Mary. "I talked with her just last Saturday. She and my sister known just where I am, where I have been living, have my telephone number and could get me on a minute's notice. I have not disappeared, never ran away and never tried to. I just left to be alone, to get away from the constant argument, from the posing, the nagging, the humiliation of being told that I myself have never done anything, would not have anything, had it not been for the watchful eye of mother and Margaret, my older sister, three years older than I. "When I was a baby, just 4 years old, they took me away from my home and my daddy. We went to New York and mother accepted a theatrical engagement. Soon afterward I was given a part and ever since that time mother's work has consisted of drawing my salary. "I was treated like a child always. Told when to go to bed, when to get up, whom to meet and whom not to meet. The very people I was working with every day were not good enough for me to associate with. I must be gracious to this and to that person because they stood high socially and were wealthy. "The power of money was drilled into me on every hand. Mother said, 'be powerful even if you have to walk across the graves of others to get it.' She has no sympathy for the misfortune of another. 'The survival of the fittest,' was her watchword. "She is her own best press agent. She knows what to say to create sympathy for herself. My sister Margaret is a 'yes-girl.' It's 'yes mamma' this and 'yes mamma' that." All of which are but a few of the things which Miss Minter said as she announced her intention to take legal steps to secure an accounting for more than $1,000,000 which she asserts her mother has collected on motion picture contracts of the daughter. Formal notice of intention to bring suit has already been served, said both Miss Minter and her attorney. The trouble in Mary's home is said to have started shortly after she became of age a few months ago. At that time Mary is said to have decided to assume control of her own money and live alone "if she felt so inclined." Mrs. Shelby has always acted as the girl's guardian and objected to any change in the arrangements. Miss Minter declares that she is capable of taking care of herself and of her own money.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 10, 1923 Los Angeles Express Famed Film Star Called Tiny "Czar" in Money Squabble Mary Miles Minter was pictured as a little "Czar" in the Shelby family in a statement made by Miss Margaret Shelby, her sister.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 10, 1923 LOS ANGELES HERALD "Mother never has refused a settlement with Mary," said Margaret. "To begin with, money was never discussed in our home. We had the happiest home imaginable. My mother has done what she thought was best for Mary and myself. It is bewildering to us why Mary has taken this stand. "It is unfortunate that Mary should make these charges just now when mother is so ill. We both love her dearly and no matter what Mary says, it will not change our attitude towards her. She can come home at any time and be received with open arms." But Mary Miles Minter smiled knowingly when told of her mother's plea for a reconciliation from her bed of pain. "My mother is not in danger of death," was her simple declaration. "It is only a ruse to get me to call off a lawsuit contemplated for the accounting of the salary I have earned. "Yes, I know, mother and Margaret say they love me better than anything else in life, that I am the very life and breath of their existence. "They should have said 'I have been' all of that. I was, for where would either of them be without the money I have made? "I do not have any affection for my mother. Let the world condemn, if it will. Even a worm will turn in time--and I have turned. Not because she is my mother. I want to love her, but she has driven me from her so far that there is no turning back. "How can my mother expect me to love and obey her when I have seen the way she has treated her own mother for years--as a glorified servant girl at my mother's beck and call. "Oh, yes I know mother and Margaret swear undying devotion to me. They should. I have been their meal ticket for years. If only they had made these protestations of love years ago, how different our lives might have been. "It isn't so very long ago since I tried to cuddle up to mother. To kiss and fondle her. What did I get? Told to 'Don't be silly' or 'Don't make a nuisance of yourself,' in private, but patted for the benefit of the world at large in public. It made a good impression, you know. "Perhaps love means more to me than it does to some young women my own age. I am 21, you know."

"I was given to understand that I could live there but could have no motion picture people or writers call upon me. Also that I had to put my lights out at 10 o'clock and could have no music in the evening. "I protested and told mother I could not live under those conditions and she said, 'Very well, then you won't live in my house until you do.' "Now you know some of the things that have made me dislike my mother. You can't go on sowing the wind without reaping the whirlwind. That's what mother is getting from me. She taught me, bit by bit, to distrust her. I can't help it. I just can't!" "Would you go back if your mother settled everything amicably with you in regard to freedom of conduct and money matters?" Miss Minter was asked. "Go back?" The wide blue eyes flashed resentfully. "Not if I had to scrub floors first. I'm through. I'm going to live my own life."

"In the patio are the things she loves--the birds in their swinging cages, the gold fish in the fountain, flowers everywhere--her tiny 'poms' waiting for her call. [4] "Mary wants her freedom to do as she wills. I have lived to protect her from that freedom until her mind is disciplined; until she is able to make wise decisions in the important things of life.

"For more than a year and a half I have kept secret that which was the sweetest and holiest thing in my life--my love for William Taylor," she said. "I loved Mr. Taylor the first moment I saw him. And today, nearly two years after his death, my love for him is stronger than ever. "I knew but little of Mr. Taylor's past life, but I knew that he was an honorable gentleman in all the word implies. He was a man's man, yet withal a man of gentleness and kindliness. He was cultured, but yet not immune to the human feelings of mankind. "I cared not who or what he was, for when he put his arms around me and said, 'Mary, I love you,' I knew that he was the one man in the whole world for me. And when I think that if it had not been for the continual bitter opposition to our engagement I would have been his wife it is almost more than I can bear. No wonder I am bitter. "My whole life was wrapped up in him. When I would come home from the studio I would dream of the home in which William Taylor and I would spend the balance of our lives. "But, no, he was too old, I was told. He was not an old man. William-- possibly you think it strange that I called him William or Mr. Taylor, but I so worshipped him that I could not think of calling him Bill--used to tell me that he would not allow me to sacrifice myself on a man his age. " 'I wonder if I am doing the right thing?' he would often ask me. 'You have brought me the greatest happiness of my life, but you have come at the time of the Setting Sun, while you are in the glory of youth.' "But I would not have it so. I knew that the years I spent with him, no matter how short, would be the happiest of my life, and we often discussed the little home we were going to build up in the Hollywood Hills. "Then came his death. It was like a bolt from a clear sky. I was simply stunned. With my soul starved for love by the life I had led at home, his tenderness and kindness seemed doubly sweet. "It was at this time that all the pressure possible was brought to bear by those under whose influence I was at the time to see that my engagement with Mr. Taylor was kept secret. "I mustn't talk; it would hurt my career; it was the same old story of hushing and shushing. The public must never know that I was engaged. I must be a little girl with golden curls. It would never do for the world to know that I was a human being instead of a doll-faced automaton."

With the passion and pathos of a literary classic they voiced of the thrill and thraldom of the deep and enduring affection of the beautiful young motion picture star for a man more than twice her age. The diary is bound in scarlet moire silk, as scarlet as the life-blood of William Desmond Taylor that stained the floor of his home on that memorable night he met death at the hands of an assassin, and in it Mary Miles Minter has recorded the yearnings and longings for her lost love. The first entry in the book was made two weeks after the death of Taylor. "Oh, my beloved, where are you?" the heartbroken girl wrote. Then she described her longing for the man whose arms would no longer embrace her. "You were to have been mine. Had I known you were to have been taken from me no power on earth could have kept us apart." It was night. In the distance music was playing. She recorded memories of happier times when music, which Taylor loved, had been a part of their lives. She told of her hours of anguish and bitter weeping for the man who was gone. "Where? I do not know, my beloved. But you are near, somewhere, of that I am certain. You could not leave me so utterly hopeless, alone and forlorn." Nine days later she again makes an entry of her grief and loss in the little book. This time "Chummy," the dog Taylor gave her, was stolen. "They have even taken away what you have given me," she wrote. "How a dog can understand! Better than most humans." Then in Honolulu, in June. Again the dancing throng of that playground of the Pacific recalled happier days with the man she had loved and lost. But she believed Taylor was not far away. She felt his presence and the little diary carried a message not of a hopeless death, but to one who had "gone away for a little time and would return again. "It is night again, dearest, our time of peace and surcease from the stress of life that grows so weary at times. Morning will come all too soon: and with its coming will begin again the weary tasks of life. Life without you, dearest, is weary. Our love was like a great white star that burns its way across the heavens. They are dancing down below. I can see them from the window. The lovely gowns look like bright colored balloons against the dark background. "Oh, Desmond, my love, where are you? Surely not so far away but that I will find you somehow, somewhere?" It was June again, in California. A year has rolled by since the last entry in the little diary. But the heart-hungry girl is still seeking her lost one. She is a woman now and realizes more fully her loss. "How long, my love, how long until you clasp me again in your dear arms?" That is the love of Mary Miles Minter for William Desmond Taylor, who rests under the golden sunshine in "God's Acre," where sleep the dead of this and other generations.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 15, 1923 Mary Miles Minter LOS ANGELES TIMES August 14, 1923 LOS ANGELES HERALD [The following is an edited combination of her own written account published in the TIMES, and an interview published in the HERALD.] Mary Minter Bares Taylor Love Affair It has happened! For months and months I have been hoping and praying that my differences with my mother might not bring up again the dreadful incidents of the murder of William Desmond Taylor. I have tried and tried to make no references to it in my statements concerning my effort to secure an accounting from my mother, but newspaper reporter after newspaper reporter has hounded me day and night always with questions, questions, questions about Mr. Taylor. The Times is the only newspaper which has not done this and because of this fact I am now giving the first statement that I have ever given under my own name. William Desmond Taylor came into my life when I was 17 years of age. He was the first man ever to call me Miss Minter. "How do you do, Miss Minter?" he said to me when first we were introduced, and then he smiled. Always before I had been called Mary and treated like a child by men and women alike, but Mr. Taylor called me "Miss Minter," which at that age, heart hungry as I was, made an instant impression. From that moment he fascinated me. I loved him the first time I saw him. "This is God," my heart sang when I looked into his face. I know the world will think that a very immature age and a very foolish conclusion for one so young. But you must remember that while for the last three years of my life my mother has tried to keep me a "little girl" with curls down my back, she earlier had made me appear and act older than I was. When I was 8 years old I was passed off for 16, twice my age, and dressed as a midget, with high heels and long skirts, so that I could play the stellar role of "The Littlest Rebel" at the Chicago Opera House. That was because the state law of Illinois prohibited children under 16 years of age from appearing as professional performers. These things have an effect upon a child that all the training and coaching in the world cannot eliminate. When I went into the movies it was different. Then mother wished to undue all the training of maturity she had imposed upon me and have me appear unsophisticated and simple, childlike and trustful. It was paradoxical. But I matured very quickly in this glorious sunshine and gorgeous setting of California. With the passing of the adolescent period, it became very evident to mother that men were attracted to me. I liked the company of men. They were jolly, good companions, splendid comrades and were not forever saying, "Don't do this," or "Don't do that." It worried mother because I was popular with them. The few with whom I came in contact were not attracted to Margaret. This was a bitter pill to both her and mother. Margaret is older than I and mother thought she should be given preference. But if a girl does not naturally attract men, all her efforts will fail. That was the status of things when I first met William Desmond Taylor. I knew when I laid eyes on him that he was the one man in the world for me, and that he reciprocated my love. It was not long afterward that we were in New England making a picture. My mother, my grandmother and sister were with the company. I used to listen for his footsteps as he came into the door of the little hotel where we stayed. I recognized them as they went up the stairway and into his room, which was just over the little parlor where we all sat. One time we all went into Boston for a dinner party for me. He rode in the automobile between my grandmother and me. The road was rough and bumpy, his arms were spread across the rear of the back seat in which we rode. One bump threw grandmother against him and he said, "I guess I will have to hold you." But his arm did not embrace me. "Dare I? Dare I?" I said to myself. I dared and I reached up and tugged at his coat sleeve and he dropped his arm about my waist. And coming home he did the same thing again. The thrill of that innocent act thrilled me for days and days. We spent what little time we could together, which was not much because mother always watched and every night after I had gone to bed she used to sit in the little parlor with him just as much as he would let her while he was working on his script. One day it rained dreadfully. We were out somewhere and he wrapped his coat about me and took me to the hotel. There stood mother, fairly raging. She accused Mr. Taylor before the entire company of taking me out, humiliating him most shamefully. For two days I hardly spoke to him and then I apologized for mother's action. "Your mother is right, Mary," he said. "She is right and you must always obey her." That was the beginning of quarrels between mother and I. He soon left and came to California. Grandmother and I came later, while mother and sister remained in the East. Sister Margaret had a sort of beaked nose and she had it operated on to straighten it out. That kept them in the East. We had a glorious reunion when we came west. Grandmother and I went riding with him, to dinner, to the theater. Then mother came. He used to call at our house. But soon mother noticed his preference for me. She put a stop to it. Until she knew of my love for Mr. Taylor, she had only words of praise for him. Then, suddenly, she turned against him. I told Mr. Taylor of her attitude. "Your mother knows best, Mary. I am an old man," he would say. Then I would kiss the words away. I did not know Mr. Taylor's age, but he was not old in spirit or understanding and that was all that mattered to me. He was mine. I wanted him, to be his wife, to be able to do the thousand and one little things for him that only a wife can do. I would have married him then and there, but he said we must wait. "Wait a while, Mary dear," he would caution. "Ah, do not think I don't want you, child. It is not that. But because of my great love for you I would shield you from the unkindness of the world. And the world would never forgive me for blighting your career. We must wait." But I did not want to wait. Perhaps many women would be ashamed to admit what I have admitted. But I am not ashamed. Our love was a glorious thing. "Why should we wait?" I would protest. As long as we had each other what else counted? Then I wrote letters, passionate, impulsive letters. Some of them were published. Many of those letters were written two years before he died. And he kept them. That was my one thought at the time. He kept them. Surely he must have loved me deeply, sincerely, to have kept them for so long. I did everything I could to make him break his resolve and marry at once. Not to wait until I was older. I loved him, oh, so sincerely and he loved me. He told me so many, many times. We were never engaged in the sense that he had asked me to marry him and I had promised. I had always hoped that sometime we would be married. But I had planned in my own mind--never with Mr. Taylor--that as soon as I had made enough money so that mother and sister could be assured of a comfortable income for the rest of their lives--that perhaps we would be married. But not engaged in the sense of wearing a ring, or of telling one's friends of an intention to marry or of telling my mother. Marrying Mr. Taylor was just my dream--a dream which, voiced to film, always met with the answer that it was impossible. Then mother took me to Europe. She told me of the lovely things we would buy over there. Things that were to be for my home, she said. Where are they today? Mother has them, if you please, and tells me they are not mine but hers. Mr. Taylor went to Europe, too. But I did not get to see him. Mother saw to that. I pleaded with her to let me see him but she always insisted that she would not permit me to throw myself at Mr. Taylor's head. So we tramped all over Europe, always careful to keep a safe distance between me and the man I loved. Eventually we came home. Mother and Margaret stopped over in Chicago and I came on west, home. I sent Mr. Taylor a message and he met me with flowers and a lovelight in his eyes that told me his affection for me had not diminished during my absence. I had a few days of delightful comradeship with him before mother returned, for my grandmother understood our great love and did not offer any interference. But when mother came home again Mr. Taylor was forbidden the house. Whenever I could I would slip away with Mr. Taylor, but the times seemed so far apart. All too seldom. Finally he told me I must not write him any more and must not call him up, that he would telephone to me. I waited a week, two weeks, three weeks and he did not call. I swallowed my humiliation and called him. His butler answered and told me he was ill. He was too ill to talk with me. I gave the butler instructions of what to make him eat, to see that he was well covered during the night. For five days he did not eat a thing and during it all I suffered more than I can express. Early in December before he was shot I had telephoned him and told him that I must see him. We had not talked with each other for weeks. We would pass on the lot and he would smile so sweetly, but in his eyes was the love- light that none but I could see. He made an appointment for me to come to his house in two weeks. Grandmother and I went. The house was dark. I was heartbroken. In the keyhole I twisted one of the little golden hairpins that I wear so that he would know I was there. No word from him, no telephone call. On December 23 I was downtown buying some Christmas presents--one for him that I never got to give him. I have it still. There in the store opposite me in another aisle he stood. He smiled so sweetly, bowed and was gone. The clerk came and brought some samples of something and I told her to wrap it up. I don't even know what it was, I was so dazed. My maid grasped me by the arm thinking I was going to faint. He went away. A few nights afterward I could not sleep. Everyone had gone to bed. I tiptoed to my grandmother's room and told her I must go to him. She tried to dissuade me, offered to go with me, but I told her no, that this was something I must do alone. I gathered up his pictures and a little golden mesh bag he had given me and stopped to write him a note. It said: "Dear William Desmond Taylor: This is good-by. I want you to know that I will always love you. Mary." I got out my car myself and went to his house. There was a light shining behind the blind. I rang the bell. All was silence. My heart stopped. I was afraid that perhaps he had gone out and that he had left the lights burning. But then I heard the rattle of a newspaper, the door opened and there he stood. "Why, Mary," he said. "It's quite late, isn't it?" "Yes, it is, nearly 12 o'clock," I answered. "But I must see you," and I pushed past him into the room. I noticed things were changed. That the furniture was moved, but on the wall there still hung my pictures, two of them and one of Mabel Normand. "Mary you should not have come here," he said. He was trembling, seemed to grow old standing before me. Perspiration covered his brow. "Here, read it. It's good-by," I said, handing him the note I had written. He read it and without a word turned to his desk, fumbled about and then handed me a note. "I thought you had gotten this two weeks ago," he said. I started to open it. "No, no," he cried. "Not here." "But I must," I said. "I must. Maybe there is something in it I must answer." "No, I beg of you, I entreat you. I cannot stand it if you do. Don't!" "Then tell me that you love me," I said. "I love you Mary, better than anything in this world, more than God," he answered. He led me to my car, helped me in. I reached out and squeezed his hand. In the house he had clenched his teeth, his face was drawn; his fingernails had been gripped so hard that he brought blood when the nails cut the skin. He had used a silk handkerchief he had tucked in his upper coat pocket to wipe away the blood. As we stood by the car door I pulled this handkerchief from his pocket and took it, handing him mine. He kissed it and slowly walked back into the house. I drove home. That was the last time I ever saw him alone. After that a few times I met him on the lot. Again he smiled and spoke, but that was all. In February one morning I was dressing. It was about 11 o'clock. I was standing in my undergarments before the mirror fixing my hair. I heard my mother's footsteps coming, pat, pat, pat down the hall. I knew something was wrong from the way she was walking. She pounded on the door. "Let me in," she said. "But I am not dressed," I protested. I had on nothing but a chemise, and mother always scolded me if I appeared before her even in a negligee. "Let me in," she fairly shouted. "Let me in or I shall break down the door." All this time she was pounding. I told her she must wait until I got into a dress and then I opened the door. "What do you think has happened?" she said. I looked at her, for she seemed greatly excited. "William Desmond Taylor has just been found murdered in his bed." She added some more words which were not altogether complimentary to Mr. Taylor. "Where were you last night?" "I was here, of course," I said, hardly realizing what she was saying. I was dumbfounded. Mother talked on in a most excited manner. I can't remember what she said--all of it--but it was something about this would teach me a lesson and how to behave myself in the future. Then mother said, "Well, why don't you say something?" I couldn't. I was too hurt. I grabbed a hat, a wrap and then began to look through my pocket book, through the drawers of the dresser. I was hunting for the keys to my car. I thought I would go frantic in the few moments that it took. "Where are you going?" mother asked. "To him, of course," I replied. "You cannot, you cannot. I shall not let you," she said and stood before the door to stop me. "You'll not leave this room. I'm going to lock you in and here you'll stay until I say you can come out." I pleaded with her. "You've kept me from the man I love in life and you can't keep me from him in death. I'll scream and raise the neighborhood. I am going to him if I have to throttle you to get past," I cried. And she stepped aside. I drove to his home in a daze. Newspaper reporters, officers and other people were before the house. They were carrying out books and papers. "Who are you and what are you doing here?" they asked me. "I am Mary Miles Minter and I have come to see Mr. Taylor," I answered. "But he is not here. They have taken him to the undertakers," they said. I got in my car and drove downtown to the undertakers. I drove and drove, round and round that block until finally I found the place. I went in. I asked to see him and they told me I could not, that they were trying to find the bullet. "I must see him. I must see him," I told the man. "You cannot see him until after the inquest," I was told. "It is against the law for me to let you see him before." Finally he promised me that I could see him the next day at noon and I went away. Then I drove to Mabel Normand's home. I was frantic. Without ringing the bell I went in. There were reporters in the parlor waiting for her. I rushed upstairs. She was dressing. I grasped her by the shoulders, shook her and looked straight into her eyes. "What do you know about it?" I asked. "Nothing," she answered simply. "Not a thing but what they have told me." And I believed her and still believe her. The next day I went to the undertakers and they let me in all alone with him. I pulled back the sheet and looked at him. But he was not the same. His skin was waxen. I leaned down and put my arms about him, my cheek next to his. His face was cold, so cold, but not a cold like ice. "Do you love me, Desmond?" I said. He answered me. I could hear his voice. "I love you, Mary; I shall love you always," he whispered. I kissed him and put a red rose in his hand from some I had brought with me. The door opened. The undertaker was there. I went away. Mother and the attorney did the talking for me. They told of my childlike affection for an old man. How I trusted and loved him as a father. But I tell you here and now it was no childlike affection. It was a full grown woman's love for her mate. For William Desmond Taylor is the one great love of my life and always will be.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 15, 1923 LOS ANGELES HERALD How old is Mary Miles Minter? Is she 30 years of age, as her father says she is? Is she 21 years of age, as her mother says she is? Or is the age of the beautiful motion picture star as much of a mystery to others as it is to herself and as she recorded in her diary, along with her heart secrets of her great passion for William Desmond Taylor when she wrote, "Nobody knows my real age." The little book, whose mute revelations of the great love Mary Miles Minter bore her ill-fated fiance, has spoke again. "Nobody knows my real age," Miss Minter wrote. "Even Jeanie McPherson, my closest friend, does not know that. They tell me I am a child. Perhaps I am. Yet I feel tonight, since you went away,"--referring to Taylor's death-- that I am 50." In news dispatches from Dallas, Tex., where he is employed on a newspaper as a proof reader, Homer Riley, who declares he is the father of Mary Miles Minter, emphatically states that Mary Miles Minter is 30 years of age. The mystery of Miss Minter's age also may throw some light upon the recent avowal of the girl that Mrs. Shelby was not acting in purely a motherly role in attempting to disrupt the romance between Miss Minter and William Desmond Taylor, slain film director. At the time of Taylor's murder Mrs. Shelby declared against the protest of Miss Minter that her daughter loved Taylor in a fatherly fashion. "She knows better than that," Miss Minter vehemently declared. "Mother knew just how I loved Mr. Taylor. There was no fatherly love in our relationship." Miss Minter then declared that her mother had endeavored to play the role of rival for the love of Taylor.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 15, 1923 LOS ANGELES RECORD Mother Loved Taylor, Says Mary Minter "Mother liked William Desmond Taylor very much. In fact she tried to interest him in herself. She sought to put me in the background and her interference in my romance was not because she wished to protect me but because she considered me a rival." This new revelation of Mary Miles Minter, casts a different reflection of the movie star's relations with her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby and leads friends of the girl to believe that perhaps love and rivalry and not finances after all is behind the quarrel between them. "Mother thought that he was more her age than mine and she sought in every way to win his favor. It was not until she discovered that he cared more for me did she cease extending him the warmth of her friendship. "When Mr. Taylor realized my mother's attitude--that she tried to keep me from him through jealousy--he, in his kind, considerate way, told me I was a little girl and that I should consider my mother. 'You know I love you more than anything in life but you must do nothing to displease her,' he told me." A report from the Shelby home today indicated that Mrs. Shelby is willing to make any settlement with Mary providing the girl gives no more interviews regarding the Taylor affair.

Mary's friends searched for her in vain yesterday. At her Pasadena bungalow it was reported that she did not come home Tuesday night and had not been there during yesterday. At the home of Mary's mother, the home on South New Hampshire Street which Mary says is really hers, and not Mrs. Charlotte Shelby's, a maid volunteered the information that Mrs. Shelby was very weak and could not be seen. Her daughter, Margaret, is the constant companion of her mother. Miss Margaret is declared to have laughed outright when she read an evening newspaper stating that in reality Mary is more than 30 years of age. Margaret, who has always admittedly been an older sister, said it was really a good joke--i.e., the item of Mary's age.

Sister Margaret was out--for the day. Mrs. Shelby too ill to be seen. Mary Miles Minter has disappeared, seemingly into thin air. Evidently the generals in both camps needed a breathing spell, or did it mean retreat? The Shelby-Minter duet was evidently to be given the soft pedal. In one short week, they had run the gamut, with Mary's high angry trills, and mother's low dignified alto. With Mary's doll story thrown into the ring for comedy, and the William Desmond Taylor case dug up to supply the tragedy. The play seemed over, and the audience ready for a new farce or tragedy.

The statements attributed to her father that she was 30 years old were officially exploded today in dispatches received from Shreveport, La., where the official records showed that she was born April 25, 1902, and christened Juliet Riley.

But Miss Minter made up for time lost away from reporters by declaring she has not "disappeared," but is only seeking seclusion, that she is "still keeping advised as to mother's health," that she has not signed any theatrical contracts as yet; and that she will be very grateful if anyone can prove to her that she is 30 years old, as reported. Miss Minter's statement is as follows: "If the Los Angeles Times or anyone else in this world can prove that I am 30 years old, I will be deeply grateful to them. I supposed I was only 21 years old. If I am really 30, I will be able to collect from my mother a much larger sum than I hoped to get. "The money I am seeking an accounting for comprises my earnings under my Lasky contract for the past three years, or, in other words, since I have been of legal age in California. The three years is on the basis that I am 21 years old. My mother has always told me that the legal age is 21 years, therefore, I had supposed I was a minor until my twenty-first birthday. As a matter of fact, however, legally I have been my own boss for three years and did not know it. "I have made considerable sums of money in pictures in the years prior to my eighteenth birthday. Therefore, if I were now 30 I could have more years of earnings for which I could seek an accounting from my mother." In the meantime Mrs. Shelby is reported as still too ill to be interviewed. Miss Margaret, upon orders of the family attorney, has nothing further to say. Word was also received from Dallas that the correct age of Miss Minter is 21 years. J. H. Reilly, her father confirmed that Miss Minter was born in Shreveport, La., in 1902. He also denied that he had made any statements to the effect that Miss Minter was 30 years of age.
