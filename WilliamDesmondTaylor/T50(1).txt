TAYLOROLOGY is a newsletter focusing on the life and death of William Desmond Taylor, a top Paramount film director in early Hollywood who was shot to death on February 1, 1922. His unsolved murder was one of Hollywood's major scandals. This newsletter will deal with: (a) The facts of Taylor's life; (b) The facts and rumors of Taylor's murder; (c) The impact of the Taylor murder on Hollywood and the nation; (d) Taylor's associates and the Hollywood silent film industry in which Taylor worked. Primary emphasis will be given toward reprinting, referencing and analyzing source material, and sifting it for accuracy.********************************************************************************************************************************************************** This is the 50th issue of TAYLOROLOGY. Truthfully, we never thought we would make it this far--here's to the next 50 issues!! For this landmark issue we are reprinting Ed King's classic article "I Know Who Killed Desmond Taylor." The article was originally published in 1930 and was reprinted in WILLIAM DESMOND TAYLOR: A DOSSIER (Scarecrow Press, 1991). Since both those sources are out of print, reprinting it again in TAYLOROLOGY will hopefully keep the article available to the public for many years to come.**********************************************************************************************************************************************************"I Know Who Killed Desmond Taylor," by Ed King, was the best recap of the murder written within a decade of Taylor's death, and is the only substantial magazine article on the case ever written by one of the detectives who was actually involved in the investigation. (Detective King is also mentioned in contemporary items reprinted in TAYLOROLOGY 8, 14, 17 and 19.) Some of the information in the article had not been revealed to the public prior to the article's original publication in 1930. The article does contain some errors which are indicated in the notes--unfortunately King relied too much on his memory and newspaper clippings, and spent too little time reviewing the official file on the case prior to doing the article.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *I Know Who Killed Desmond Taylorby Ed. C. King Special Investigator, District Attorney's Office, Los Angeles, California as told to Alberta LivingstonOriginally published in TRUE DETECTIVE MYSTERIES September and October 1930The "bumping off" of a famous person like William Desmond Taylor is the sort of oyster that any detective delights to open, so you can just bet the family jewels that I was pretty much elated when my "Chief," the late Thomas Lee Woolwine, District Attorney of Los Angeles County, called me into his private office on the morning of February 3rd, 1922, and assigned me to represent his office in the investigation of this greatest of all murder mysteries. And, almost from the very first hour of my investigations, I have KNOWN who committed this murder. Yet, at the present time, the evidence is so limited that were the guilty person to come forward and confess the murder, "he" would have to produce corroborative testimony before "his" confession could be accepted. "He" would be compelled to substantiate "his" confession by other credible testimony in order to prove "his" guilt and secure "his" own conviction! And that includes even Edward F. Sands--the one person who practically every investigator in Los Angeles believes was the slayer. With this knowledge locked in my heart for the past eight years, my position has forced me to carry on a nation-wide investigation, reaching from the Pacific to the Atlantic seaboard, from the race tracks of Agua Caliente, to the frozen depths of the Alaskan goldfields, knowing full well that each new clue would lead me just where I expected it to lead--nowhere. During these eight years the case has been revived for discussion more times than I can remember. Always there has been a repetition of old stories--a dressing up in new garb of the figures in this murder mystery. Many times the murderer of Taylor has been reported discovered. The report has always created the greatest sensationalism. And, each time the story has proved to be pure fiction. Each time the guilty person has been some unnamed ghostly personage, designated by the press by blanks and asterisks, or referred to only as "that film celebrity," or "this noted actress." At the time William Desmond Taylor met his tragic death, he resided in the exclusive Alvarado Court Apartments on South Alvarado Street, Los Angeles. This court is composed of sixteen apartments, housed in eight two-story white stucco buildings, overlooking beautiful Westlake Park. In 1922 the Westlake Park district was the favorite residential neighborhood for motion picture people, who have since emigrated to the Hollywood and Beverly Hills sections. In the apartment adjoining Taylor's on the west, in the same building, lived Edna Purviance, leading lady for Charlie Chaplin. [1] Directly to the east, the buildings separated by an eight-foot parkway, lived Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean. Mr. MacLean has long been considered one of the foremost movie comedians. William Desmond Taylor was at once the favorite and the mystery of the motion picture colony. A cultured, dignified gentleman with a charming personality and considerable magnetism, the men with whom he worked were devoted to him, and most of the women fell in love with him. He never blazoned his good deeds from the housetops, but "Bill" Taylor and his charities were household words in the motion picture profession. On February 2nd, 1922, about 7:00 o'clock in the morning, Henry Peavey, colored valet-servant, arrived at Taylor's home to prepare breakfast, as usual. [2] He picked up the milk bottle which stood on the front doorstep, inserted the key in the lock, pushed open the door, but did not enter. [3] Instead, he uttered a piercing shriek that aroused all the neighbors. Someone called the police and Detective Lieutenant Tom Ziegler, from Central Detective Bureau, was detailed to the scene. Lieutenant Ziegler found William Desmond Taylor lying stretched full length on the living room floor, stone dead. He was fully clothed. His head was towards the east wall, feet near the door, legs outstretched. An overturned chair lay nearby. [4] A large crowd of people were milling in and out of the apartment and about the body, which Ziegler did not touch. He requested everyone to leave the house. A doctor, whose name was never learned but who was in the crowd when Lieutenant Ziegler arrived, made a preliminary examination of the body without moving it from its original position. He gave as his opinion that death was due to natural causes, possibly heart trouble. A few moments afterward, while Ziegler was awaiting the arrival of the Coroner, Mr. Charles Eyton, prominent member of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, husband of Kathlyn Williams, movie actress, and a close personal friend of Mr. Taylor during his lifetime, arrived upon the scene. Mr. Eyton went directly to the upper floor, to the bedroom of Taylor, where he collected many letters and personal belongings of Taylor, among which may have been much documentary evidence in this murder mystery. Lieutenant Ziegler did not interfere with Mr. Eyton, knowing him personally and also knowing him to have been a close friend of Mr. Taylor's. Eyton carried this collection of letters and other evidence away with him, and later destroyed them. When questioned regarding his motive, he stated that among Taylor's possessions were many love letters from married women, and that he did it merely to protect "Bill," as he called Taylor, from becoming involved in any scandal and not with a desire to obstruct any investigation into the matter of Mr. Taylor's death. Before Mr. Eyton left the apartment, he returned to the body, talking to Lieutenant Ziegler, who repeated the opinion expressed by the unknown doctor. Not satisfied that death was due to natural causes, Eyton turned the body over. It was then discovered that the deceased was lying in a pool of blood. The pool had not spread to such an extent that it was exposed to view as the body lay upon the floor. Lieutenant Ziegler saw at once that it was a case for the Homicide Squad, and telephoned headquarters. The Flying Squad, which at that time consisted of H. H. Cline, Ray Cato, Wiley Murphy, "Billy" Cahill, and Jesse A. Winn, responded. Investigation disclosed that Taylor had been shot in the back, the bullet ranging from the right side of the spine rather low in the torso, upward through the left breast, where the bullet had lodged in the muscles near the left shoulder. [5] The bullet hole in the coat did not correspond exactly with the one in the vest, which indicated that Taylor had been standing with his arms above his head when shot. The first theory advanced was that Taylor was holding his arms above his head in response to the command of the intruder to "stick 'em up!" A second theory was to the effect that he was reaching for the chair which was found overturned near the body. If reaching for the chair, it would seem that a controversy had taken place and that, in all probability, Taylor knew his attacker. But, if holding up his hands, he was more than likely taken by surprise. My theory was, and always has been, that when Taylor returned to his apartment, after having escorted Miss Mabel Normand to her automobile, he seated himself at his desk, and his assailant, hiding in the room, stepped out and fired. Taylor died instantly, pitched forward, and in falling upset the chair. Due to the prominence of the victim, the news of the murder was flashed all over the city, extras appearing upon the city streets in an almost unbelievably short space of time. Hollywood, ordinarily serene, playful and carefree, was no longer calm. The atmosphere of make-believe that has always seemed to hover over that portion of Los Angeles, where lived and worked so many of those whose careers and fortunes were centered in the world of finer arts, was gone. One of its most dearly loved members had been brutally done to death-- not a man with a past--not one at whom a finger of even the remotest suspicion had ever been cast. Rather, one who represented the very highest in the manly types of manhood. The coroner arrived, the body was removed, and the detectives, hot after a motive, began a thorough search of Taylor's living quarters. The apartment, which consisted of five rooms, was tastefully furnished. A baby grand piano occupied one corner of the living room. [6] The small desk stood directly in front of the door. There were books in profusion, mostly philosophical and sociological. Relics of war and much expensive bric-a-brac occupied prominent places throughout the house. Around the wall of the living room was a solid border of autographed and framed photographs. Among them was one of Mary Pickford, which bore the inscription, "To my nice director, William Desmond Taylor, the most patient man I have ever known--Mary Pickford." In a prominent place on the piano stood a picture of another Mary. On this photograph was inscribed: "For William Desmond Taylor--artist and gentleman. Mary Miles Minter." [7] On the desk in the living room lay an open check book, a pen nearby. In the drawer of the desk was a half-completed income tax report. In Mr. Taylor's pockets was found $78.00 cash. A two-karat diamond ring and a platinum watch were found on his person. The finding of the articles eliminated the robbery motive almost immediately. [8] The check book and the half-completed income tax report were seized upon as important clues. The bank book showed a balance of only $6,000.00. All other assets that could be found amounted to only about $25,000.00. The income tax blank showed Taylor's income to have been in the neighborhood of $40,000.00 per year. What had he done with all his money? He lived very simply, made no important investments, yet he had drawn large checks of which there was no record. Among the cancelled checks was found one for $2500.00 made out to cash. This amount had been withdrawn the latter part of January. The pass book showed this same amount deposited a few hours before his death. [9] To the minds of the detectives, this could have but one explanation-- blackmail. The money had been withdrawn to pay some person--a person who would not accept a check. Taylor, deciding not to be the victim of this plot, returned the money to the bank. The blackmailer called, was met with refusal and ended the argument with a bullet. But who? And WHY? Soon after the news spread, friends came rushing to the apartment. From all quarters they came. Mary Miles Minter rushed into the house in a tempest of hysterics. Following closely came Mabel Normand [10]--beautiful, impulsive, unfortunate Miss Normand, who succumbed Sunday, February 23rd, 1930, to tuberculosis in the Pottenger Sanitarium, at Monrovia, California. And, almost her last words were, "I hope before I die that they find the slayer of William Desmond Taylor." Miss Minter, at the present time, is ill in a sanitarium near Santa Barbara, California, being treated by Doctor Sansum, a leading dietician. Miss Minter told detectives that Miss Normand and Mr. Taylor were engaged at the time of his death. [11] Miss Normand admitted that she had called on Mr. Taylor a few hours before he was shot, but denied the engagement. "There was no affair of the heart between Taylor and myself," sobbed Miss Normand. "His feeling for me was that of an older man for a girl who admired him, and who was not afraid to show her admiration. "I was eager to glean a little knowledge from the vast storehouse which he possessed. He was a man who knew everything. Besides having the education and instinct of an artist, he was a deep student of science and of philosophy as well." Future references to Miss Normand are made only that the reader may have full details of the story. While she became the central figure in the sensational investigations, I do not hesitate to say that all suspicion cast upon her was unjust. Miss Minter said that she had not seen Mr. Taylor for some time, nor had she been to his apartment recently. "He was one of my best friends," she cried. "His death is a great shock to me. I cannot conceive of the character of a person who would voluntarily wrong him or cause his death. There is no personal or financial sacrifice that I would not make to bring the slayer to justice." Among Taylor's effects were found a woman's pink silk nightgown and a lace handkerchief, both with the initials, "M. M. M." [12] In the toe of a riding boot in the closet were found many letters, written in code, signed, "Mary." These letters were ardent love letters and received a great deal of publicity, but knowing the author as I afterward learned to know her, well, I wouldn't say they were so hot--just a young girl unshamedly confessing her love for the man she loved. [13] "What shall I call, you wonderful man?" began one of these letters. "I want to go away with you--up in the hills--anywhere--just so we can be alone. "Wouldn't it be glorious to sit in a big comfy couch by a cozy warm fire with the wind whistling outside, trying to harmonize with the faint strains of music coming from the Victrola? "I would sweep and dust (they make the sweetest dust caps, you know). Oh, yes, and fix the table and help you wash the dishes, and then, in my spare time, darn your socks. "I'd go to my room and put on something scant and flowing; then I would lie on the couch and wait for you. I might fall asleep, for a fire makes me drowsy. Then I would awake and find two strong arms around me and two dear lips pressed to mine in a long, sweet kiss..." Another letter, written in the same code, simply said: "I love you--Oh, I love you so. God, I love you so. I love you--I love you--I love you." These letters, along with the nightgown and handkerchief, were taken to the police station and booked as evidence in the event the murderer should ever be apprehended. Early in the morning, February 3rd, 1922, District Attorney Woolwine called me into his office where he handed me a letter--an anonymous letter in a woman's handwriting, evidently written by a lady of refinement. This letter said that if Mr. Woolwine would send a detective to Mabel Normand's apartment, located at Seventh Street and Vermont Avenue, a careful search of the basement would reveal a .38 caliber pearl-handled revolver. This was the gun with which the murder had been committed. Mr. Taylor had been murdered with a .38 caliber revolver. The bullet taken from the body indicated this very clearly. Mr. Woolwine explained to me that he wanted me to enter the investigation alone, independent of all officers of the Police Department, but this I found impossible. The officers from the Police Department had a day's start on me. My investigations led directly into theirs, so Lieutenant Jesse Winn and myself joined up as a team, and have continued so throughout the entire period of the investigation. (Winn, like myself, after more than twenty years' service on the Police Department, retired therefrom and accepted a position as special investigator in the D.A.'s office.) I went to Miss Normand's apartment, accompanied by Lieutenants Winn, Murphy and Cline, where we made a thorough search of the house, including the basement. From cellar to attic we went, devoting a great length of time to turning over everything where it would be possible to hide a gun. In a dresser drawer in Miss Normand's bedroom we found two .25 caliber revolvers, neither of which could have had any connection with the murder. No other gun was found. Miss Normand had been the last person to see William Desmond Taylor alive, with the exception, of course, of the murderer. She had been with Mr. Taylor in his apartment up to a very few minutes of the time that he was murdered. Her statement, substantiated by the statement of her chauffeur, William Davis, was to the effect that she had spent the afternoon in the shopping district of Los Angeles. Around 6:00 o'clock in the evening she went to the Hellman Bank, at the corner of 6th and Main Streets, where she placed some very valuable Christmas gifts in her safety deposit box. While in the bank she called up her home. In answer to her questions as to whether or not anyone had called her, the maid replied: "Mr. Taylor has been trying to get you all afternoon. He left word that he has a good book for you; wants you to stop for it this evening." Miss Normand returned to her limousine, parked at the curb, and said, "Well, William, we will stop by Mr. Taylor's on the way home." At Seventh and Broadway Miss Normand purchased some peanuts and a number of magazines, including a Police Gazette. She munched peanuts and read this Gazette on the way out, strewing the shells on the floor of the car. Some time between six and seven o'clock they reached the Alvarado Street address. Miss Normand stepped from the machine. As she started toward the house, Davis asked, "Shall I go get my dinner?" To this Miss Normand replied, "No--I am tired and have an early call to the studio. I will be right out." When Miss Normand entered the apartment, Mr. Taylor was in a closet telephoning to Antonio Moreno, a close personal friend of his, and a well known movie actor. Henry Peavey, colored valet, was preparing the evening meal. [14] Miss Normand, waiting for Mr. Taylor to finished his conversation with Mr. Moreno, paced up and down the living room, and as Henry Peavey afterward related to us, was continually eating peanuts and throwing the shells on the floor, much to Peavey's disgust, as it was his job to keep the apartment clean. [15] Her attention seemed focused upon two photographs on the piano--one of Mary Miles Minter and one of herself. When Mr. Taylor had finished his conversation, he came out of the alcove, greeted her cordially, and gave her the book he had mentioned. This book proved to be a heavy tome on German philosophy. Taylor and Miss Normand were among the very few in Hollywood who did any heavy reading. While these two sat on the davenport in the living room and discussed this book, Davis, the chauffeur, swept the peanuts shells from the car, then picked up the Police Gazette which Miss Normand had left lying on the seat. Henry Peavey came out on his way home, kidded Davis about the magazine and the peanut shells, then went on down the street towards Sixth and Alvarado. Miss Normand remained in the house about thirty-five minutes in all, then came out, accompanied by Mr. Taylor. The chauffeur and the director exchanged friendly greetings. A general conversation ensued, Taylor chiding Miss Normand good-naturedly about the Police Gazette. It was quite dark. Miss Normand noticed a light burning in the apartment of Edna Purviance, and knowing that Miss Purviance had been ill for several days, suggested to Mr. Taylor that they go up and see her. Mr. Taylor insisted that she go home, as she was extremely nervous, and they could call upon Miss Purviance some other time. [16] Miss Normand stepped into her limousine, and as it rolled away from the curb, she blew a kiss to Taylor. It was an eternal farewell. Mr. Taylor entered the apartment through the door which he had left open. It is presumed that he sat down at his desk to work--the murderer, hiding in the room, stepped out and fired. Taylor died instantly, and in falling pitched forward, overturning his chair. The murderer then hurried from the house and disappeared through the alley. [17] Mrs. Douglas MacLean, in the adjoining apartment, heard the shot. The MacLeans were at their evening meal. Mr. MacLean had just finished eating and had gone upstairs for a cribbage board. Miss Jewett, servant girl, had been serving dinner. At about the time Mr. MacLean reached the bedroom upstairs, and while Mrs. MacLean was still seated at the table, the shot was fired. Mrs. MacLean spoke to Miss Jewett, asking if that noise had not sounded like a shot nearby. She rose from the table and walked to her living room door. The figure of what appeared to be a man had just emerged from Mr. Taylor's door. The person was not hurrying out but was coming out backwards. [18] The thought suggested itself to Mrs. MacLean that he was talking to Mr. Taylor, who was possibly seated at his desk directly in front of the door. The figure turned, closed the door, faced Mrs. MacLean as it came down the steps, and made a turn eastward, then to the north, passing between the Taylor Apartment and the garage, going towards Fourth Street, where it disappeared in the dark. [19] This person did not hurry at any time, but walked very leisurely and looked full at Mrs. MacLean standing in her doorway. Her suspicions were not aroused, and she attributed the report she had heard to the backfire of a passing automobile rather than a shot from a gun. Later, in describing this person in the office of Mr. Woolwine, she stated that the figure had worn a heavy coat of the mackinaw type, a cap, and a muffler about the neck. She further stated that this person appeared to be a man, but if it was a man, it was a "funny looking" man. When pressed as to just what she meant by "funny looking," she explained that she had been on the movie lot a great many times with her husband during the filming of pictures and had seen many actors and actresses in make-up and they were "funny looking." The person emerging from Mr. Taylor's apartment had this same appearance. Arthur Hoyt, a motion picture actor, close personal friend of the deceased director, was living at the time of Taylor's death, at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, Seventh and Olive Streets. On account of his close friendship with Mr. Taylor, Lieutenant Winn and myself felt that he undoubtedly would be able to give us valuable information concerning the habits and past life of the director. We visited Mr. Hoyt in his room on several occasions, and one night, possibly a week and a half after the murder, Detectives Cato, Cahill, Winn and myself, decided to question him more closely than we had on previous occasions. After about two hours' grilling Hoyt broke down and wept. He told us that it was not his desire to break confidence with his dead pal and friend, but that he believed he would have to do so if it would help to unravel the mystery surrounding the murder. He then told us that on the evening of the last day of January--the evening before the murder--he had arrived at his apartment at the Athletic Club, and had partaken of several drinks, after which he started out, as was his custom, to visit his friend, William Desmond Taylor. When he arrived at Taylor's residence, somewhere in the neighborhood of 6:00 o'clock, he found Mr. Taylor seated at his desk, nervously running his fingers through his hair, preoccupied and worried. Feeling in the mood for another drink, Hoyt went straight past Taylor, and on into the closet where the telephone was located, and where he knew Taylor kept his liquor supply. Hoyt took from the closet two bottles, one containing whiskey and the other seltzer, and started mixing a couple of cocktails. "Don't mix me any," said Taylor. "I do not care for it." Noting his depression. Hoyt went over to him and questioned him as to why he was worried. Taylor swore Hoyt to secrecy, saying that if he would promise not to breathe it to a living soul, he would tell him something that was causing him a great deal of worry. Mr. Taylor then told Mr. Hoyt that the dearest, sweetest little girl in the world was in love with him, and that he was old enough to be her father. This little girl was madly in love with him--had been to his apartment the night before, coming at nearly 3:00 o'clock in the morning. She had insisted on remaining. He had insisted on her going home, whereupon this little girl had cried and threatened that if he tried to put her out, she would scream and cause a scene. This, of course, Mr. Taylor wanted to avoid, as he had many friends in the neighborhood. He finally persuaded her to leave, driving her to her home. Mr. Taylor stated to his friend Hoyt that this little girl had become so infatuated with him that it was really becoming serious. He was worried-- didn't know what to do about it. Mr. Hoyt then said, "Bill, I know who you mean. It is ---" And Taylor admitted that it was. [20] The beautiful young girl named by Hoyt was interviewed by Winn and myself at her home. She stated that she had not seen Mr. Taylor for a long time, the last time being on the streets of Los Angeles. Mr. Taylor was in his own car and she in hers. They merely waved to each other. This statement was not true. We were able to prove that she had been in his apartment many times, and had actually been there the night of the murder. We had never been satisfied that the person seen by Mrs. MacLean, emerging from the Taylor residence, was not a woman in disguise as a man, inasmuch as Mrs. MacLean had stated that it was a "funny looking" man. Winn and myself thought out a plan whereby we might learn something definite regarding this matter. We went to the office of Nick Harris, private detective, and explained to him what we had in mind, knowing that he carried a standing with the daily press which would enable him to get almost any story run. We explained to Mr. Harris that we wanted him to call the editor of a daily paper and tell him that a funny thing had just occurred; that Winn and myself had just called at his office and that while we were seated there in conversation with him, the telephone bell rang, and a woman was on the other end of the wire, who stated she was a spiritualist. This woman stated that the night before she had had a vision in which the murderer of William Desmond Taylor appeared; that the murderer was a woman with a very beautiful daughter; that Taylor had been too familiar with the daughter; that the mother in desperation had shot and killed Taylor, and that, in her estimation, the mother was justified. The spiritualist continued that she thought it was the mother's duty to come out and tell the truth--tell the authorities that she had committed the murder and why she did it; that she was going to give the mother two weeks' time in which to explain to the public that she was the murderer of Taylor, and why she had committed the murder. That, at the end of that time, if the mother hadn't come forward and told the truth, she, the spiritualist, intended to make it public. He concocted this story merely for the purpose of seeing what the result might be. The evening paper ate it up and ran almost a column story about it. [21] The following morning an attorney visited the District Attorney's office with the clipping from the newspaper. He wanted to know the name of the spiritualist, where she was located, if she had mentioned in her conversation the name of the woman with the beautiful daughter, and many similar questions. I explained to him that all I knew about it was merely what had happened while we were in Mr. Harris' office. This attorney returned on the second day and made further inquiry. There was no one else who every made inquiry about this news item. Secret investigation revealed this man to be the personal attorney for the mother of the beautiful girl whom Taylor had told Mr. Hoyt was madly in love with him. Lieutenant Winn and myself next went to the property room at police headquarters and endeavored to secure the clothing worn by Mr. Taylor at the time of his death. We found that this wearing apparel was still at the undertakers. When we arrived at the Ivy Overholtzer mortuary, we were just in time. They were about to burn the clothing, as it was covered with blood, and they considered it of no value. Under the collar of the coat and extending possibly from one-half to one inch, were three long, blond hairs. These were compared by an expert with combings taken from the dressing room of Mary Miles Minter, and pronounced to be the same. At this period women were wearing long hair, it being before the days of the bob. These hairs were placed in an envelope and left with the property clerk at Central Police Station for safe keeping. After finding these hairs, Miss Minter was called into the D.A.'s office and requestioned. She could add nothing to her previous statements. After questioning Miss Minter, we went to the home of her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, to question her regarding any knowledge she might have of the mystery. Mrs. Shelby was preparing to leave for New York on the 6:00 o'clock train. When I requested an interview, she came to the door, fastening her dress. She informed me coldly that her attorneys, Mr. Mott and Mr. Cassill, were in the house for the purpose of answering questions, and that she was in too much of a hurry to reach New York to devote any time to an investigation about which she knew nothing. We next questioned Mary [Julia] Miles, mother of Mrs. Shelby, and grandmother of Mary Miles Minter. Mrs. Miles stated to us that Mrs. Shelby was out on the evening of the murder until about 9:00 o'clock: that she had been shopping during the day and visiting friends early in the evening. About this time District Attorney Woolwine ordered all the evidence in the case transferred from the Police Station to his office, where it was placed in a cabinet. All this evidence later disappeared, and in a conversation with Robert Herron, of this office, I learned that he was ordered by Woolwine to take the articles, except the coat and vest, to Woolwine's home. Possibly the letters, the hairs, the handkerchief and the nightgown were turned over to Miss Minter, Woolwine being a close personal friend of both Miss Minter and her mother, Mrs. Shelby. While we had been working on the case from the love, revenge and jealousy motive, other detectives, working on the blackmail theory, had dug deep into Taylor's past life. [22] Born in 1877 [1872], in Ireland, Malloss [Carlow], County Cork, he was the son of a British Colonel and an Irish gentlewoman. His upbringing was one of every advantage, with special attention paid to his education along military lines. His father desired him to follow in his footsteps in the British army, and with this purpose in view of becoming an engineering in the King's army, he studied in a number of European colleges and universities. Because of poor eyesight, however, he was a failure in the army, and at the age of eighteen he made his first contact with the stage, becoming secretary to the famous Charles Hawtrey Company. This was not satisfactory to his father, the stern British Colonel, who objected to everything connected with the stage, so he purchased for his son a ranch in Harper, Kansas. Taylor spent two years on this ranch, but the stage had gotten into his blood. Fanny Davenport came along, invited him to play juvenile parts in her company, and, armed with a three-year contract, Taylor left the ranch in Kansas. On the stage he met with varying success. When the famous Klondike gold strike occurred, the spirit of adventure in his Irish veins evidently, for the moment, crushed out the stage from his desires, and he joined other daring souls in Alaskan lore. The year 1914 found him in Hollywood. Like scores of his former friends, actors and actresses, he left the stage for the silent drama--the footlights for the Kleigs. After making several pictures for Vitagraph, Kay Bee, and other companies, these pictures including "Captain Alvarez" and "The Iconoclast," he turned from his place in front of the camera to the more important one behind, took up directing, and in 1922, he was looked upon as one of the greatest directors who ever shouted, "Camera." At the outbreak of the World War Taylor enlisted as a private in the Canadian Army. He was one of the first 100,000 to sail overseas from Quebec [sic]. He soon rose from private to the rank of Captain, commanding a truck train running from Dunkirk to the British front. This much of Taylor's life was known to his friends of the motion picture world. Unfeigned astonishment was felt by all when we dug still deeper and found that he had actually lived a dual existence. In 1901 he had married one Ethel May Harrison, a member of the original Floradora Company. They had one child, Ethel Daisy, who was found in an exclusive girls' school at Mamoroneck, Long Island. Prior to 1908 he was known in New York as William Cunningham Deane- Tanner, a cultured art connoisseur. He had one brother, Denis Gage Deane- Tanner. One day in 1908 friends and business associates were startled by his sudden and mysterious disappearance. His wife could give no clue to his whereabouts and could ascribe no reason for his action. An examination of his books showed everything in perfect shape. After an extensive search, the family and friends set it down as an unsolved mystery. His wife divorced him and later remarried. Further investigation disclosed that four years after Taylor disappeared from his home in New York, his brother, Denis Gage Deane-Tanner, disappeared from his home in New York under similar circumstances. He, too, had married and was head of a family. That any domestic difficulties were responsible for his disappearance was denied by his wife. Mrs. Ada Deane-Tanner had suffered a nervous breakdown and went into the Adirondacks to recuperate. When she returned with her two small daughters, her husband was missing. The books of the firm by whom he had been employed disclosed the fact that he was in no way involved in financial difficulties. Detectives scoured the world for a trace of this missing brother, but from the day he disappeared no trace of him was ever found. Six years before the death of William Desmond Taylor, Mrs. Ada Deane- Tanner had recognized a picture of him, and appealed to him for aid. He, at first, denied his identity, but later sent her an allowance of $50.00 per month, which had continued during the entire six years. Mrs. Tanner could give us little information regarding Taylor, as she had seen him but once. [23] Inquiry in New York showed that Taylor's wife had learned his identity when she and her daughter, Ethel Daisy Tanner, attended a picture show. Taylor's image was flashed upon the screen. "That's your father!" exclaimed the mother. The daughter sought his address and wrote to him. Afterward letters were frequently exchanged. When Taylor returned from a trip to Europe, he revealed himself to her, and stated that he would make her his heir. About this time we received a letter from a man in Denver, Colorado, who claimed that he had known the Tanner brothers intimately. This letter stated that one Edward F. Sands, former secretary to Taylor, was none other than the missing Denis Gage Deane-Tanner; that at one time William, the older boy, had won the love of his brother's fiancee, and for many years the younger brother had hunted the older, swearing vengeance. [24] The finger of suspicion had been pointed at Sands early in our investigations. He had first become involved in the meshes of the law after Taylor had returned from a trip to England about a year before. Taylor reported to the police that Sands had robbed him of money, jewels, clothing and a costly car. He claimed that there were many discrepancies in his accounts upon his return. Before going he had signed a great many checks to be used for current expenses. These checks had been used by Sands for other purposes, and Taylor's name forged to many others. Twice Taylor's home had been burglarized. In the first burglary the place had been thoroughly ransacked, clothing and much valuable jewelry taken. The expensive automobile also disappeared at this time, but was later found in a badly damaged condition. Then came a second burglary about two weeks before the murder. At this time the rear door was smashed in, the place ransacked, but nothing except jewels and a stock of distinctive cigarettes was taken. [25] A week after this burglary Henry Peavey, colored servant, found a gold- tipped cigarette of this distinctive brand on the front doorstep. He took this to Mr. Taylor and asked him if he had purchased more of them. Taylor replied that he had not. The cigarette was undoubtedly some of the stolen stock. Shortly thereafter Taylor received a mysterious letter signed, "Alias Jimmy Valentine." enclosed in this letter were two pawn-tickets for two suits, silver plate, jewels and household goods. The letter read: "Sorry to inconvenience you, even temporarily. Also observe the lesson of the forced sale of assets. A Merry Xmas and Happy New Year. Alias Jimmy Valentine." The stolen articles had been pawned under the name of William Deane- Tanner, showing that the one who had pawned them was familiar with Taylor's true history. Then penmanship was compared with the handwriting of Sands and declared by experts to be the same. Taylor then swore to a warrant for Sands' arrest, charging him with two counts of Grand Larceny. [26] Could this warrant be construed as a possible motive for the murder? Was the story of the two brothers true? Surely Sands must have had some hold upon Taylor. Why the insolent assurance in pawning Taylor's stolen things in the name of Deane-Tanner and sending the pawn-tickets with the "alias Jimmy Valentine" letter? Was there a skeleton in the family closet? Some dark and secret feud in the family that could account for the fatal shot? The interval elapsing since Taylor's disappearance in 1908 and his appearance in Hollywood in 1914 had been made the subject of exhaustive inquiry, but had remained veiled in a cloak of secrecy. [27] What about those hidden years in Alaska and elsewhere? Had the long arm of the past reached forth and stricken him down? A hot search was then started for Sands. Every police officer and law enforcing agent in the United States was furnished with a description and a picture and told to arrest him on sight. Records disclosed that Sands had enlisted twice in the United States Navy, once under the name of Edward F. Sands and again under the name of Edward F. Strathmore, deserting both times. This was established by fingerprints on record in the Navy Department, Washington, D. C. [28] About this time "dope" was injected into our investigations. Taylor, himself, was not an addict, but it was rumored that he had attended several "hop" parties to get atmosphere and local color for his pictures. A number of his friends, however, including several women, were known drug addicts. Taylor was reported as having fought the narcotic ring for some time, but there was no tangible evidence to connect him in any way until Tom Green, Assistant United States Attorney, in charge of drug prosecutions, made a statement to the effect that Taylor had appealed to him for help to effect the eradication of the "dope ring" which was supplying narcotics to a certain actress. At that time, according to Taylor, this actress was paying in the neighborhood of $2,000 a week for narcotics. From Chicago came a report that a Chinese dope peddler had murdered Taylor. Investigation of this report was soon ended when the Chinaman, Harry Young, alias Harry Lee, was located in Folsom prison. [29] One John Narizara was arrested in Toledo, Ohio, and while in jail stated that he knew who killed Taylor; that it was one Jack Kramer, a Los Angeles dope peddler. Kramer had confessed the murder to him and when Narizara had said he was going to tell the police, Kramer and another peddler had threatened to frame evidence against him as being the slayer. Narizara was examined by the Lunacy Commission and sent to the Psychopathic Ward. [30] One "Red" Kirby was arrested by police officers in a rooming house on West Washington Street, in Los Angeles, he being a "hophead," and having made certain remarks, overhead by tenants of the house, these remarks being in regard to the murder of Taylor, and that Taylor "got what was coming to him." Kirby was released when the officers were satisfied that he could not possibly have had any connection with the murder. We delved deep into this phase of the matter, thinking the whole scheme of the crime might be laid in a setting in which the sale of drugs was the mainspring. Early one morning Captain David Adams, of Central Police Station, received a telephone call from the editor of a newspaper in the City of Santa Ana, advising him that if he would send some of his men to Santa Ana, and to his office, he would give them some information that appeared to be extremely valuable in connection with the murder of Mr. Taylor. Captain Adams called Lieutenant Winn and myself and gave us this information. Winn was detained in the city on another portion of the investigation, so Captain Adams and I proceeded to Santa Ana, and to the office of the editor, who told us the following story: On the day prior to our visit, one Andrew Cock, a rancher living near Santa Ana, came to the newspaper office and reported that on the day before Taylor was murdered, he, Cock, was going through the town of Tustin, adjoining Santa Ana, late in the evening. It was raining. Two roughly dressed men stepped out into the road directly in front of his car, and demanded a ride. [31] Mr. Cock permitted these two men to get into the front seat of the machine with him, as he was driving a Dodge touring and the rain was beating into the rear seat of the car. On the way from Tustin to Santa Ana these men inquired regarding stages running between Los Angeles and the Mexican border, especially those leaving Los Angeles. One of the men, who referred to the other one as "Shorty," began a conversation concerning a Canadian captain in the World War. He did not mention any names but stated that this captain had been extremely severe in discipline, and that they were members of a company in the regiment commanded by this captain. He stated that they were going to Los Angeles to kill this captain, whereupon "Shorty" told the other man to keep his mouth shut. Mr. Cock had been afraid of these men and not wishing to carry them any farther then he had to, stopped in the main street of Santa Ana and told them he was not going any farther. As the two men left the automobile, "Shorty" dropped a pocket gun which Mr. Cock described as a short .38 caliber revolver. Mr. Cock started to drive away. Shorty said, "Wait a minute." He then stopped and picked up the gun which had fallen into the muddy street, took a red bandana handkerchief from his pocket, and wiped the gun off by the light on the cowl board of the machine. It was then that Mr. Cock had an opportunity to see the gun and determine the caliber. Mr. Cock was called to the newspaper office by the editor and again related the story to us in detail. We made arrangements for him to accompany us to the border--to Tia Juana and Mexicali--and if possible, to point out the men, if they still remained in either of the border towns. Mr. Cock explained that he had delayed reporting this matter for the reason that his wife was afraid of what might happen. But, after reading the story of the murder and that Mr. Taylor had been a Captain in the Canadian Army during the World War, he felt sure it was Taylor to whom the men had referred. [32] The following day Lieutenant Winn, Cock and myself went to Mexico in search of these two men. We went to the Chief of Police of Mexicali, who, after hearing our story, detailed Detective Mendoza, of the Mexicali Police Force, to accompany us on a round of the saloons, dance halls and other resorts. The Chief informed Mendoza that if Mr. Cock succeeded in locating these men, or either one of them, he, Mendoza, was to escort us to the border and put them over as undesirable citizens of Mexicali, and that once across the border, we could take charge of them. We made the rounds of these resorts during the early hours of the evening. Into one saloon and out, into the dance halls and into gambling houses--into all sorts of resorts--we went. At last, about 11:00 o'clock, in a saloon near the famous Owl Resort, Mr. Cock pointed out a young man standing at the bar with several men and women who were drinking. He stated that it was his belief that this young man was one of the men that was in the automobile with him, and who had discussed the killing of the Canadian captain. This man proved to be none other than "Red" Kirby, who had formerly been arrested by police officers and released. Detective Mendoza brought Kirby to the street from the bar room, where Winn and I started following them towards the line fence between Calexico and Mexicali. Mendoza finally stopped Kirby and informed him that he was on Mexican soil; that he did not have to go over the line if he did not wish to go; that we were detectives from Los Angeles; and that if he went over the line we would undoubtedly arrest him and take him to Los Angeles. Mendoza then proceeded to ask Kirby if he wished an attorney to represent him, stating that if so he would procure one. Winn and I then talked for what seemed to be hours with Kirby, trying to induce him to cross the line to his room in a rooming house in Calexico, not referring to the Taylor murder, but leading him to believe that we desired to search his effects in his room, thinking him to have been connected with some of the numerous burglaries that had been committed in Los Angeles. After a great length of time we finally persuaded him to cross the line. "Come on, you guys!" he exclaimed, exasperated. "You've got nothing on me. I'll take you to my room and show you what I got!" He then took us to a rooming house where we went through the suitcase which we found in a closet, and found only a very few articles of wearing apparel--soiled shirts, ties, a shaving outfit, and other articles of this nature. No pictures or letters were found. We then told Kirby what we really wanted, and turning to Mr. Cock we asked him if he were positive in his identification of Kirby as being one of the two men he had picked up in Tustin and carried to Santa Ana. Cock looked Kirby over carefully and stated that since he had had an opportunity to see Kirby under a good light and to hear his voice, he was convinced that Kirby was not one of the men we were looking for. [33] We returned to Los Angeles. Kirby remained in Mexicali where he continued using "dope"--being a "hop" addict. Some time later his body was found in what is known as Mexicali wash, back of the town of Mexicali. An autopsy showed that he had died from an overdose of the narcotic he had been using. [34] When we arrived in Los Angeles we found a letter awaiting us from the Warden at Folsom Prison, concerning two convicts confined there, who, in the opinion of the Warden, had committed the murder of Taylor. The Warden had intercepted notes written by these convicts to each other. I was rushed to Folsom Prison. When I arrived at Folsom Prison I had a long talk with these two men, Charles Wadleigh, known as "Solly," and J. G. Barrett, alias "Black Buck" and "Black Bart." "Solly" Wadleigh was a shell shock victim of the World War. He was not considered mentally responsible at the prison. He impressed me as being sincere in his statements, however, and not mentally so unbalanced as some might think. He had been received at Folsom as a recidivist, having been sentenced to San Quentin from Sacramento to a term of five years to life on a first degree robbery charge. During his trial he had attempted suicide. Barrett, or "Black Bart," impressed me as a person who would stop at nothing to gain his own ends. He had been badly shot up in attempted escapes, and carried many ugly wounds to show for it. He appeared to be one of those conceited, cock-sure individuals with an air that shouts at you, "Suppose I did commit the crime. It is so well covered up that you will never be able to prove it!" Wadleigh stated that he and Black Bart had been engaged in narcotic traffic in Los Angeles, and that among their many customers were many movie stars. Taylor was trying to curb or break up the business of selling dope to his friends in pictures, with as little notoriety as possible. For this interference on the part of Taylor, there was an understanding of some kind. Two well-known movie stars were in on the deal, and Taylor was shot and killed by Black Bart after he had had trouble with Taylor. Wadleigh stated that on the night of the murder he was ordered by Black Bart to drive to within a short distance of Taylor's home. When they arrived Black Bart went in, shot Taylor, and came back at once, picking up one of the movie stars referred to above, a short distance from the house, and the other about a block farther on. They drove to 5th and Spring Streets, and on the way one of the movie stars passed a large roll of money to Black Bart. The two women then left the car at the corner. Wadleigh further stated that Black Bart was getting money from someone outside the prison all the time--in his opinion from one or both of the two women--that he had bought his way into the prison hospital for $45.00, which had been paid to a crooked official, in the hope of escaping. Black Bart, according to Wadleigh, was urging him to escape with him for the reason that he was afraid he would talk if left behind, but Wadleigh felt sure that once they escaped, Black Bart would murder him to silence him. After talking with Wadleigh, I called Black Bart out and had a long talk with him. At first he was not inclined to talk about the Taylor case, and appeared greatly frightened at the mention of it. Finally, after much persuasion, he admitted that he had had a man driving for him, who was in the same prison, but he would not mention his name as "I never squeal on a buddy." He then admitted that he was near Taylor's home on the night of the murder; that he did pick up the two movie stars referred to, and that there was a large sum of money passed between one of them and himself, but he would not say that he had killed Taylor. He denied that he had killed him, but when I asked him to be a good fellow and tell me what he had done with the gun, he said, we could never prove him to be the murderer, and that he would be a fool to tell us anything or admit his connections with the case. He would discuss his life in Los Angeles rather guardedly, and when I told him he could talk freely of his business, even if it were unlawful, as there was a statute of limitation, he laughed and replied, "But there is no statute of limitation for murder." He told me that he and Taylor had had trouble on three occasions; that Taylor was interfering in his business, which was narcotics; that he brought the stuff into the country from Mexico by airplane; that he did not make deliveries personally but had others in his employ who did. I have neglected to mention that "Solly" Wadleigh had stated that Henry Peavey could verify his statements as he knew that Black Bart killed Taylor; that Sands was in on the job and that Bart had killed Sands to silence him and that he had buried the body, but where he could not say. After listening to both stories, which sounded very fishy to me, I decided to follow them up and make a complete investigation in an effort to prove or disprove their statements. At the end of my investigations, which consumed days and days, I was firmly convinced that the one and only underlying motive behind the whole affair was the desire for escape. These two men had been much in each other's company. There was no need of their writing the notes to each other. Therefore, they had been written with the expressed purpose in mind that the officials would intercept them. Both were serving life sentences. A trip to Los Angeles meant an opportunity to escape. Even if they were not successful, they would have had the trip, and to a lifer, that much time spent outside the prison walls means much. From time to time information regarding the whereabouts of Sands reached our office. Each clue was followed through to its source. A man answering his description had joined an expedition to the Cocos Island, acting in the capacity of cook. A man of his description committed suicide in a small town in Kansas. He was seen here, there and everywhere. An appeal was made to him through the press to come forward and clear himself of the murder charge, the D.A.'s office promising not to prosecute on the various other charges they had against him. But Sands never showed up, which is not surprising. A man with a deserter's record, facing State's prison for forgery, burglary, and grand larceny, is not anxious to meet up with the police, notwithstanding any promise of immunity made by the District Attorney. On March 16th, 1922, Mary Miles Minter sailed from San Francisco for Honolulu on the liner Wilhelmina under the name of Miss Juliet Shelby. In August [May] she returned and there were rumors of a break between her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, and herself. On August 10th [1923] Miss Minter gave a statement to the press which confirmed these rumors and revealed her intentions of bringing court action against her mother in an effort to gain possession of the fortune she had made while in pictures. "The gauntlet is down," Miss Minter is quoted as saying. "I want no reconciliation with mother. I most assuredly am going to file a legal suit against her for the return of at least a million dollars which I feel is rightfully mine. My salary while in motion pictures was more than a million dollars. Mother has handled all my money, made wise investments and prospered. "I have been the wage earner--the family meal ticket ever since I was five years old. I wasn't given a chance to get more than three or four years of actual schooling. Mother was ambitious socially and financially, and I had to turn beauty and talents into cash. "My last contract called for eighteen pictures for which I was to receive one million, three hundred thousand dollars. When I asked mother for an accounting, she showed me figures--one hundred and seventy-five thousand credited to her; one hundred and sixty-five thousand credited to me; all household expenses for the three of us, mother, my sister Margaret, any myself, had been deducted from my share. "If I wanted ten dollars I had to ask mother for it. I am determined to live like other people--to live a life unhampered by maternal restrictions. I am sure there is no real love in my mother's heart for me. I have attained my majority now, and have reached a point where I am willing to lay my case before the public to gain my rights." When this announcement was made, it was learned that Mrs. Shelby was ill at the Good Samaritan Hospital. When Mary heard of her mother's illness, she said, "Just an old ruse of hers. Whenever I have tried to secure a little freedom, she always flies into hysterics and becomes ill." Mrs. Shelby declared that Mary was not capable of handling her own finances and that she must be protected from herself. "Why, Mary cashed her last pay check, one hundred thousand dollars, and in three months it was all gone!" Mary came back with the reply that the pay check only amounted to $63,000.00; that no sooner had she received it than she invested in Hollywood real estate which increased in value from $37,000.00 to $65,000.00; that she paid $7,000 income tax, all her living expenses, and still had some of the original amount left in the bank. To this Mrs. Shelby only replied, "The greatest gift God gave me, I gave the world--and it devoured her." Matters quieted down, Mary saying that she would wait until she was sure her mother had recovered before she brought suit. On Tuesday, August 14th, the name of Miss Minter and her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, again occupied the front pages. Mary, for the first time, bared details of her romance with William Desmond Taylor, stating that they had, at the time of his death, been engaged. [35] "For more than a year and a half I have kept this secret. My love for William Desmond Taylor was the sweetest and holiest thing in my life," she said. "Any girl would have been proud to be engaged to him as I was. I longed to tell the truth to the world. There was nothing to be ashamed of in my love. But, on the advice of my mother, I kept still. I wanted every one to know that I loved Mr. Taylor with the pure, wholesome love of a young girl. But the influence of my mother prevented me from making it known at the time of his death. "I loved him the first moment I saw him. Today that love is as strong as ever--but the continual bitter opposition--he was too old--he was too this-- and he was too that. "Even he thought at first that there was too great a difference in our ages. 'You have brought me the greatest happiness of my life, but you have come at the time of the setting of the sun, while you are in the glory of your youth. I cannot allow you to sacrifice yourself to a man of my age,' he said one night when we were planning our future life together. "When I was eighteen we were to be married. [36] Then came his death. It stunned me. At that time all the pressure possible was brought to bear by those under whose influence I was to see that my engagement was kept secret. I mustn't talk--it would hurt my career--the same old story of hushing and shushing. The public must not know that I was engaged. I must be a little girl with long golden curls. It would never do for them to know that I was a human being." If Miss Minter was stunned by the death of Taylor, her mother was knocked off her feet by Mary's story. When she read it in the morning paper, she was overcome--prostrated with grief. Rather than have the family history aired in court, she announced that she was ready to compromise with her daughter. Financial matters were adjusted and the two become reconciled. Their names disappeared from the front pages. Mrs. Shelby went abroad and Mary went into seclusion. District Attorney Woolwine resigned from his office and some time later passed away. He was succeeded by Asa Keyes, and the investigation continued in a haphazard sort of way for the next four years. As many as a dozen persons "confessed" the murder, none of whom could have had anything whatever to do with it. Mr. Keyes finally marked the case closed, and thus it remained until December 21st, 1929, when Ex-Governor Friend W. Richardson, in an exclusive interview with a representative of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin, exploded what the newspapers later referred to as a "detonating political bombshell," and dragged the 8-year-old Taylor mystery from the records once more. "I know who killed William Desmond Taylor," said the former governor. "A motion picture actress killed this director, and I have positive proof to this effect." After going into the history of his differences with Asa Keyes, in 1926, Richardson said, "About that time, I heard that a prisoner in Folsom knew all about this murder. "I went to Folsom and investigated the case, then went to Los Angeles where I told the foreman of the Grand Jury and the chairman of the Jury's criminal committee that I had the solution of the Taylor murder mystery. "I asked them whether the facts should be presented to the Grand Jury and if so, if there was any chance for an indictment. The answer was, 'No.' They explained that either Keyes or one of his deputies would be in the Grand Jury room and that before any person could be brought to trial for murder, the important witnesses would be spirited away, bribed or murdered. "I returned to Sacramento, called the Prison Board and explained the situation. I told them that already the word was around that I had the solution of the murder, and that unless we took quick action the convict in Folsom Prison would be murdered. "The convict was pardoned by me and the last I heard of him he was in Vera Cruz, Mexico." When asked why he had not presented the facts to Buron Fitts, who eventually succeeded Asa Keyes as District Attorney, Richardson was quoted as saying that he "left the Governor's office before Fitts became D.A. Anyway, the witnesses we had then probably we could not get together now." Governor Richardson further claimed that Asa Keyes, who is even now in the County Jail awaiting the outcome of his appeal on a conviction of bribery, had "stepped on the case." This Keyes from his cell denied, declaring that he was being used as a political football. He issued a formal statement in which he said: "If Richardson has the proof why doesn't he produce his evidence now? Murder never outlaws. [Murder does not have a statute of limitations.] The murder happened in nineteen twenty-two when Thomas Lee Woolwine was District Attorney, and while Buron Fitts and I were both deputies in his office. No stone was left unturned then or since to uncover the secret of the murder." When questioned by representatives of the press regarding this new development, the present D.A., Buron Fitts, refused to comment other than to say that he might question Mrs. Charlotte Shelby regarding the matter, as, so far as he could learn, she was the only one who had never been subjected to a thorough grilling. This remark drew a bitter condemnation from Mrs. Shelby, who, in a signed statement, asked that she be cleared of all suspicion in connection with Taylor's death. She said, in part: "After seven years of silence I now unsolicited give my first published statement regarding reference made to me in connection with the death of William Desmond Taylor. "I feel in justice to myself, my name, my integrity and my rights as a citizen of the United States, that I must express my indignation at the injustice done me. I returned from Europe, after three and a half years spent in search of health, on November seventeenth of this year. "I have been maligned, and by innuendo, directly or indirectly, implicated in connection with the tragedy. "There is not a single word of truth in anything that has been said connecting me with the case, nor has any public official the slightest evidence which would serve in any way to prove, or even indicate, that I ever did have, or know information which would lead to the arrest of the person responsible for Mr. Taylor's death. "I have nothing to conceal. I am willing, and have always been, to talk to any authorized person from the District Attorney's office, and will repeat to the District Attorney what I am saying now if he wishes to see me. "I appeal as a woman of honor and integrity, one who never wronged anyone, contrary to all reports to the public, for justice and to clear my name of slander and misrepresentation. "I am now establishing my home in Los Angeles. "I feel I have a right to live peacefully and enjoy the confidence and respect of my fellow men." Thus she ended her statement. Neither Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, nor her daughter, Mary Miles Minter, have ever been accused of anything by the District Attorney's office. The ex-convict to whom Governor Richardson referred was known to be one Otis Hefner. Hefner's complete statement was as follows: "I came out of Texas, a green and uneducated young fellow in my twenties, and got in with a bad bunch in Southern California. They were smarter than I was, and altogether too fast company for me, but I was useful to them in doing odd jobs, and I can see now they carried me along to make me the goat. "This clique was primarily engaged in the dope racket. There was a lot of money in it. They got the stuff off the boats at San Pedro and cleared it through a pharmacy in Los Angeles. "One of these crooks was Edward Sands, who had ostensibly worked as a chauffeur and valet for William Desmond Taylor. Actually, Taylor was distributing a lot of 'hype' to people in the movie business, including the actress who committed the murder. "Taylor and Sands had a falling out. Taylor left on a trip and when he returned he publicly accused Sands of robbing his home of clothing and jewelry. Sands didn't make any pretense of working for Taylor after that, but I think the robbery was all the bunk, for Sands continued to deliver dope to Taylor and get his money for it. "Sands must have been about forty years old. He was a pretty good sort of a guy, for a crook. He always treated me square and I always got my money on time. "I met him about six months previous to the murder on a movie location in Santa Ana Canyon. I was doing some electrical work for the company, and he drove Taylor out in Taylor's car. We got talking and became friends. "Word was passed around in this dope ring that Taylor had turned 'rat' and was tipping us off to Federal officials. I heard several conversations in which it was remarked that Taylor would be 'bumped' off if he didn't play square. At first I paid no attention, as a lot of that sort of talk was going around; but they kept repeating it and pretty soon I got really interested and began to think they meant business. "On the evening of February 1st, 1922, Sands and I were out at Redondo Beach on a job and saw Taylor and two motion picture actresses having dinner at a cafe. "We went back to town and Sands went to his apartment for a few minutes, while I waited outside. He told me when he came down that he had just talked with Taylor on the telephone, at Taylor's home, and that we were to deliver some 'hype' to the latter. "Sands went and got a big limousine, which he said was Taylor's and had been loaned to him. He picked up his stuff at the pharmacy, and we drove out to Alvarado Street. "This was about two o'clock in the morning. We parked the car across the street from Taylor's bungalow court. Sands and I left it and crossed Alvarado Street. There was another limousine at the opposite curb, with a driver at the wheel and the motor going. A woman was coming down the short steps from the entrance to the bungalow court. She was wrapped in a fur coat, either black or dark brown. I recognized her. "She passed Sands and me and got into the limousine hurriedly, and drove away. [37] "Sands told me to wait for him on the sidewalk, while he went in with the bundle. He came back almost immediately and hurriedly crossed the street to our car, motioning me to step lively with him. As we left the curb I noticed a man in the bungalow court at the rear, adjoining Taylor's home, but directly facing Alvarado Street, open the shutters of a window and look out. I read in the papers afterward that this was Douglas MacLean's home. "When we were in the car, Sands said to me: 'It's time to be going. The old man's got his. He's stretched out deader than a mackerel.' "We went downtown and separated. I went to Santa Ana and later to San Pedro. I went back to Los Angeles next Saturday evening to find out what was going on and ran into Sands. I saw him next day, too. He was leaving for San Pedro to take a boat for Mexico, and told me where to reach him at Vera Cruz. "I exchanged several letters with him at Vera Cruz after that. He kept telling me to keep my mouth shut and not to mention his name. "Sands did not kill Taylor; I'm sure of that. I don't think he meant to run away when he started to Mexico; I understand he was going to arrange for more narcotic shipments. "It think Taylor was shot down between about 1:45 a.m. when Sands and he talked together on the telephone, and 2:30 a.m. when we beat it from the Alvarado Street address. "I did not travel with the gang after that, and, having lost the guiding hand of Sands, I got into several jams and was sent to Folsom. At the prison I told something of this to Buck Cook, who squealed to the prison officials. "Thomas Gannon of the prison board then called me and asked me what I knew about the Taylor murder." Shortly after Governor Richardson made his startling charges, Otis Hefner was found by a newspaper reporter, living under the name of Arthur Nelson, in Redwood City, California. Hefner repeated his story as told above, stating that both he and Sands had positively identified the motion picture actress seen rushing from the apartment. No sooner had the Taylor case resumed its place on the front pages than Henry Peavey, ex-servant and valet of Taylor, was located in Sacramento. While Hefner's story covered events immediately after the murder. Peavey told a story purporting to reveal what had happened the preceding evening while Taylor was still alive. "I went to [sic] Taylor's home about 7:00 o'clock in the evening. I wanted to check out for the day. When I got to the door of the room I heard loud talking inside and hesitated to go in. "I recognized the voice of the girl, who was a prominent motion picture actress and who had formerly been on much more friendly terms with Mr. Taylor. "I had an appointment downtown, so after waiting for about ten minutes, I knocked on the door and opened it. I saw Taylor and the actress. I told Taylor I was leaving, closed the door, and went out, leaving them together. "I learned later from Taylor's chauffeur that he phoned the house at 7:20 and got no response, and when he found the place dark later, he went on home. "The murder was evidently committed then, between 7:10 and 7:20 p.m. and Taylor's body was found next morning in the room where I left him with the actress. [38] "I know she was very angry with him because he did not care so much for her as he once did, and was paying attention to another motion picture actress." When Peavey had finished his story he assured his questioners that he was eager to come to Los Angeles and tell his story to the Grand Jury. "You didn't tell this same story at the Coroner's inquest?" "No, they wouldn't let me. They tried to shake my story. They threatened me. I didn't change my story, but I left out the part about the row at Mr. Taylor's." "What do you mean by 'they'?" "The District Attorney's office." We placed no stock in Peavey's statements. We had questioned him thoroughly a number of times immediately following the murder, and he had never told us any story that would indicate that Taylor had been murdered by a motion picture actress. I am sure that he told everything he knew at the beginning. He was the pride of Central Avenue at the time (Los Angeles' Negro belt)--bought himself a new pair of spats, and became the most important person in town in his own estimation. If he had known more he would have sprung it for the added glory and glamour. There were those who thought he was concealing something at first. But, after some newspaper boys took him to the cemetery and sweated him over a gravestone, and couldn't get any more out of him, they were satisfied. [39] As for the District Attorney's office not allowing him to testify to the full facts at the coroner's inquest, I don't believe he could have testified to anything correctly at the inquest. He took one look at Taylor's body, became half hysterical, and his chin shook so that we could hear his teeth chatter all the way across the inquest room. We had no more confidence in the story told by Hefner than the one told by Peavey. In my opinion he had concocted his story of events in the Taylor mystery from reading newspapers and discussing the crime with other prisoners for the sole purpose of effecting his release, and so successful had he been in convincing Governor Richardson of the authenticity of his statements, that the executive paroled him in 1925. Hefner violated this parole, was sent back to prison, only to be re-paroled again in 1926. But, not wishing to leave any stone unturned, my boss, District Attorney Buron Fitts, ordered me to go north for an interview with Hefner. On Friday afternoon, January 10th, 1930, I took the Owl train to San Francisco, where I interviewed Mr. Crissey and Mr. George Powers, of the Daily News, as it was they to whom Hefner had told his latest story. Hefner, they stated, was living at 205 Redwood Avenue, Redwood City, which is located on the peninsula some thirty-five miles south of San Francisco. Mr. Powers explained that one Tommy Jones, who had been living with Hefner, and working with him at the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, of San Mateo, California, was thought to be the missing Edward F. Sands. Jones, who, according to Mr. Powers, fitted the description of Sands, had, within the last few days, disappeared from his hotel and his place of employment. There was a portion of his salary due at the company office, which Jones had failed to collect. On Saturday afternoon, January 12th, I took a machine from San Francisco and drove to San Mateo, then to Hefner's home in Redwood City. While in San Mateo I went to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and talked with R. W. Briggs, gang foreman of the electric lines, who explained to me that Tommy Jones had been employed as a lineman and worked under his supervision. Mr. Briggs produced his time book which showed Jones had not quit his job within the last few days, but on December 6th, 1929; and stated that the description of Sands did not fit the description of Jones in any way, Jones being a much younger man. I showed Mr. Briggs the picture I had of Edward F. Sands. Mr. Briggs called several linemen who knew Tom Jones very well, and all stated that the picture of Sands could not possibly be the picture of Jones. Mr. Briggs also explained that Tom Jones was an extremely ignorant man; that he could scarcely read or write, and had trouble signing his own name. He was a Southerner and spoke with a distinct southern drawl, talking continually of coon hunting and 'possum hunting in the South. Jones, when he left the employ of the gas company, had stated that he was taking his wife and two children to the vicinity of Phoenix, Arizona. I then went to the St. James Hotel where Jones had formerly lived and was told by the landlady and several of the roomers that Jones couldn't possibly be Edward F. Sands. Having established conclusively that there could be nothing to the Sands story as concerned Tom Jones, I proceeded to the Hefner home in Redwood City, where I found the house locked up with the curtains all pulled down. The mail box contained mail from several days. I returned to San Francisco for the night, but early the next morning I again set out for Redwood City, determined to watch the house of Hefner for his return. About 9:00 a.m. I telephoned Edward Whyte, State Parole Officer, and he informed me that if I would come immediately to his office in the Ferry Building, San Francisco, he would produce Hefner for me, as Hefner was in hiding at Whyte's suggestion to keep away from newspaper men. I went directly to Whyte's office and after a few moments' conversation he brought Otis Hefner from an adjoining room. Tall, lean and bronzed, there was little about Hefner to suggest the ex- convict. No trace of prison pallor was left and the deep tan of his face gave his eyes an intense appearance. Hefner started to repeat the story he had told the newspapers, but before he had talked two minutes, I was convinced that he couldn't possibly know anything of the details of this murder. "Hefner," I said, "you're lying to me. When you first told your famous yarn to Ex-Governor Richardson, you lied. After you told your first lie, you've been forced to tell a thousand others to cover up. Now, come clean. Am I right?" A broad smile--a sigh of relief--tears trickling down his cheeks--then Hefner replied: "Yes, King, you are right. I told a lie to get out of Folsom Prison and I've been compelled to tell many others to keep out. I have been working hard since my release to re-establish myself as a good citizen. My wife has been sick. We are paying for our little home and it just about takes all I earn. During the three years I have been out, I have never left home except during working hours." After several further remarks, I decided I did not wish to interview him any further, but I wanted him to tell his story first-hand to Mr. Fitts. He agreed to go to Los Angeles with me provided I would agree to keep the newspaper men and cameras away from him. He explained that he did not want his wife to know of his former prison record. She was seated in his machine with their young baby out in front of the Ferry Building. He wanted me to go down to the machine with him and explain that he must go to Los Angeles with me, but merely as a witness in an important matter. He asked me to avoid all mention of his past life. This I did, meeting Mrs. Hefner and the baby. We made arrangements for Hefner to take the wife and baby to the home of Mrs. Hefner's sister in Oakland, there to remain until his return to San Francisco. Mr. Whyte, parole officer, confirmed his statements, adding that Hefner had accounted to him for every penny of the money he had earned at hard labor for the past three years; had lived a straightforward and upright life ever since his release on parole; and regardless of his fake story, he thought justice could best be served by allowing him to return to his wife and baby, so, after a talk with the District Attorney, we furnished him transportation and allowed him to return home. With the revivified search for a solution of the eight-year-old mystery of who killed William Desmond Taylor, came other "confessions" from all over the country. A man in Birmingham, Alabama, confessed that he had been an eyewitness to the murder. He claimed to have been hidden behind the piano in Taylor's apartment where he had sought refuge, when Taylor and a woman whom he named entered. This woman soon left and a second woman entered, dressed as a man. Taylor reprimanded her for masquerading and they argued over the woman's demand for money. Taylor gave her a check which she tore to bits. As she was about to leave, the "confession" continued, this woman drew a gun and shot Taylor. By shifting his position, he could see Taylor as he slumped down in his chair and crumpled to the floor. This "confession" was highly imaginative, practically improbable and undoubtedly false. The piano in Taylor's living room was a small baby grand model and it would have been next to impossible for anyone to hide behind it and escape detection. We examined the room for hiding-places and eliminated the piano the first day of the inquiry. There was not a place in the room where a man could possibly have remained hidden. There were many other discrepancies in his story. He described a vestibule and there was no vestibule. He described Taylor's desk as a "colonial" style desk, while in reality it was a small roll top desk with pigeonholes. Whoever murdered Taylor slipped in through the front door when Taylor accompanied Mabel Normand from his home to her waiting automobile. When Taylor re-entered the house, his murderer stepped out from behind the partially open front door and shot him from behind. This fact alone proved the falsity of his story, which he had so constructed that the assailant had to shoot from in front. Since the re-opening of the case, we have been receiving as high as 100 letters a day, coming all the way from the Yukon on the North and Florida on the South. And, it is remarkable how many persons in the United States have vital information concerning the murder. I don't understand how they've kept their secrets locked up in the breasts for the past eight years. All they need is an opportunity to come to Los Angeles, and according to their letters, the mystery would be solved. I might add that we are expected to pay the freight both ways. Today the Taylor case is listed among the great unsolved crime mysteries of the world, the chances being good that it will stay there. Dope, love, jealousy, revenge, blackmail--all have entered into our investigations. There was never a particle of real evidence to connect Taylor with a dope ring. The only way love and jealousy entered into the case was through the admission of Mary Miles Minter, who confessed unashamedly that she loved William Desmond Taylor. Never, for one moment, have I suspected Mabel Normand of knowing anything about the murder. I questioned her many times when she was completely off her guard. If she had known anything, the truth would have come out. The revenge motive was found only in connection with Sands. Taylor had threatened his arrest and filed charges against him. Taylor's unlocked home and his way of living without a retinue of servants made it comparatively easy for his slayer to enter his bungalow, shoot him and get away without leaving a single clue. As stated in the opening paragraph of my story, almost from the first hour of my investigation, I have known who committed this murder. But knowing it and proving it are two separate things. However. I am a great believer in the law of retribution, and I feel positive that some day this law will make good in the case of William Desmond Taylor. [40]********************************************************************************************************************************************************** NOTES: [1] Edna Purviance did not live in the same building as Taylor. Taylor lived in apartment 404B and the other unit in his building was 404A. Edna Purviance lived in 402A, in the building directly to the west of Taylor. See LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (February 12, 1922). Other early press reports also indicated that she lived in the next building. [2] According to Peavey's testimony at the coroner's inquest, he arrived at Taylor's home at 7:30 a.m. [3] According to Peavey's testimony at the coroner's inquest, he brought a bottle of milk of magnesia which he had obtained at a drug store, and picked up the newspaper (not milk bottle) from Taylor's doorstep before opening the door. [4] Peavey testified at the inquest that "a chair that was sitting next to the wall had been pushed out a little bit and his feet was under this chair." The chair was not overturned. A diagram of the crime scene in the Los Angeles Record (February 2, 1922) had the chair upright and astride one of Taylor's legs. On February 10, District Attorney Woolwine returned to the crime scene with E.C. Jessurun, the first person to actually enter the room that morning, and a photo was posed in the exact same position as the body was originally found; again, the chair is astride the left leg and not overturned. See LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (February 11, 1922). Also see Sidney D. Kirkpatrick, A CAST OF KILLERS (Dutton, 1986), p. 164. [5] King's description of the path of the bullet is highly inaccurate. According to the testimony of the coroner at the inquest, the bullet entered Taylor's left side and travelled upward, lodging near the base of the right side of his neck. [6] Taylor's apartment was too small for a baby grand piano. Press reports, diagrams, photos of the murder scene, and Taylor's probate documents all agree that the piano was an upright. [7] The actual inscription read: "For William Desmond Taylor-Artist, Gentleman, Man. Sincere good wishes. Mary Miles Minter. -1920-". A reproduction of the photo can be seen in the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (February 4, 1937). [8] Nevertheless, rumors of the robbery motive persisted. On the afternoon before his death Taylor had met with his income tax advisor, J. Marjorie Berger. She told reporters that Taylor had shown her a large roll of bills he had with him at that time, a roll much larger than the flat $78.00 found on his body the next morning. See LOS ANGELES RECORD (February 17, 1922). [9] This rumor of a large withdrawal was reportedly discredited, and it was found that the deposit was primarily Taylor's paychecks, and not cash. See LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (February 15, 1922, reprinted in WILLIAM DESMOND TAYLOR: A DOSSIER, pp. 380-1). [10] Mabel Normand did not return to Taylor's apartment on the day the body was found. She first returned there after the inquest on February 4, to show the detectives how the furniture had been arranged during her last visit with Taylor. [11] Although there was a press report to this effect, there was also an interview where Minter denied any knowledge of an engagement between Taylor and Normand. See LOS ANGELES RECORD (February 3, 1922). [12] There were also authoritative reports that the nightgown had no initials. See LOS ANGELES TIMES (February 4, 1937, reprinted in WDT: DOSSIER, p. 369). [13] Press reports of the time indicated that it was Mabel Normand's letters, missing for the week following the murder, which were found in the toe of Taylor's boot, having been planted there by Charles Eyton who had earlier removed them from the apartment. Two coded love letters from Mary Miles Minter were found earlier by reporters, and there was no indication that they were signed. Photos of two of the letters were reproduced in the Hearst press. Minter later admitted writing the letters to Taylor, during 1919. See Minter's statement reprinted in TAYLOROLOGY 11. [14] Taylor had eaten the evening meal at 6:30, and Peavey was just cleaning up afterwards when Mabel Normand arrived. [15] Most of Mabel Normand's own statements indicated that she did not enter Taylor's apartment until after he had finished the telephone conversation. There was no mention elsewhere of her dropping peanut shells on Taylor's floor, and it seems doubtful based on other reporting of the scene. She did drop peanut shells in her car while her chauffeur was driving her to Taylor's, and perhaps King has confused the incidents. [16] In her own statement to the press, Edna Purviance said she was not home that evening, and did not come home until 11:45 p.m., when she noticed the light burning in Taylor's apartment. See LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (February 12,1922). [17] Although King evidently believes Taylor was seated at his desk when the shot was fired, other investigators concluded Taylor was standing when he was shot. See A CAST OF KILLERS, p. 164, and LOS ANGELES RECORD (March 27, 1926, reprinted in WDT: DOSSIER, p. 365). [18] According to Mrs. MacLean's statements, when she first saw the man he was standing outside of Taylor's door. See SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER (February 6, 1922, reprinted in WDT: DOSSIER, pp. 333-5). [19] The man walked towards Maryland St., not Fourth Street. [20] The preceding is undoubtedly a reference to Mary Miles Minter. Although King indicates Minter's late-night visit to Taylor took place two days prior to the murder, other statements in the police file indicate her visit took place several days or weeks earlier; see WDT: DOSSIER, pp. 328-329 and TAYLOROLOGY 7 (Robertson's statement indicates that Taylor related this incident to Hoyt on the previous Saturday [January 28] which would mean that the incident described took place earlier). It's possible that Minter's visit took place in December 1921; see LOS ANGELES TIMES (August 15, 1925, reprinted in WDT: DOSSIER, pp. 254-5). [21] King gives the impression that this "psychic's phone call" story was given to the press a few days after the murder, but it actually happened eight months later. See LOS ANGELES TIMES (October 4, 1922). This was the first rumor to appear in the newspapers implying Shelby had killed Taylor. [22] The biography which follows is primarily from studio sources, and contains various errors, including the wrong date for Taylor's birth. Taylor was in the British, not Canadian, Army (see TAYLOROLOGY 40). [23] Although Ada Tanner had seen Taylor but once in California, she previously had seen him in New York. [24] For the complete tale, see DENVER POST, (February 10, 1922). Denis Deane- Tanner could not possibly be Edward Sands. See CHIGAGO HERALD-EXAMINER (February 8, 1922) and LOS ANGELES TIMES (February 3, 1937, both reprinted in WDT: DOSSIER pp. 392-393). [25] This burglary was on December 4, two months before the murder. [26] The warrant charging Sands with grand larceny was issued in July 1921, after the first theft by Sands. See WDT: DOSSIER, p. 318, and TAYLOROLOGY 19. [27] See TAYLOROLOGY 29 for information on Taylor's whereabouts between 1908 and 1912. [28] The earlier Navy enlistment was reportedly under the name of Edward F. Snyder, not Sands. Sands had also deserted from the U.S. Army under the name of Strathmore, and also had enlisted in the U. S. Coast Guard. See TAYLOROLOGY 19. [29] Press reports indicate Harry Young, alias Harry Lee, was located in Folsom prison in 1930 but that he had been in Los Angeles at the time of the Taylor murder. Lee's 1922 cellmate reportedly said Lee had confessed killing Taylor for $1000 on behalf of a drug gang. See LOS ANGELES RECORD (January 6,1930). Lee was found at Folsom, denied killing Taylor, and said that he was one of the first arrested as a suspect in the murder but was released after three days. See SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE (January 7, 1930). Lee's earlier arrest was reported on March 3, 1922, indicating Lee had a quantity of cocaine, opium and drug paraphernalia, plus a .38 caliber pistol; it was reported that he was questioned about the Taylor murder but denied any knowledge of it. See LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (March 4, 1922). [30] The individual King calls "John Narizara" was referred to in the press as "John Marazino." See LOS ANGELES EXPRESS (December 20, 1922). [31] For the original newspaper account of this item, see SANTA ANA REGISTER (February 17 and 18, 1922). Those press items say the incident took place on January 30, which was two days prior to the murder. [32] Of course, the reports that Taylor was a captain in the Canadian army, were erroneous. He was in the British army. [33] Upon his return, Andrew Cock was again interviewed by the SANTA ANA REGISTER (March 18, 1922). He reportedly stated that he was uncertain as to whether or not Kirby was the man he saw earlier. [34] Walter Kirby's death was reported in the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (May 3,1922). Contemporary press articles refer to Kirby as having the nickname "Whitey," not "Red." [35] This interview revealing her "engagement" was from the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER. But in her written statement to the LOS ANGELES TIMES (August 15,1923), she wrote: "We were never engaged in the sense that he had asked me to marry him and I had promised. I had always hoped that sometime we would be married. But I had planned in my own mind--never with Mr. Taylor--that as soon as I had made enough money so that mother and sister could be assured of a comfortable income for the rest of their lives--that perhaps we would be married. But not engaged in the sense of wearing a ring, or of telling one's friends of an intention to marry or of telling my mother. Marrying Mr. Taylor was just my dream--a dream which, voiced to film, always met with the answer that it was impossible." [36] Minter was nineteen when Taylor died, further indication that much of this "interview" was probably fabricated by the reporter. [37] This obviously was supposed to be Mabel Normand. [38] The time of 7:20 p.m. for the telephone call of Taylor's chauffeur was given in a second-hand account. When Peavey was interviewed by reporters directly he said the unanswered call was at 7:30. Peavey had stated at the inquest that he left Taylor's apartment at about a quarter past seven, so that would place the time of death between 7:15 and 7:30 p.m., if Peavey were correct. The actress referred to by Peavey is obviously Mabel Normand. King's account omits Peavey's statement that the woman and Taylor were loudly arguing. [39] King is wrong here, and his attempt to discredit Peavey does not stand up to impartial examination. The 1922 press evidence clearly does show that Peavey told the authorities he thought Normand killed Taylor. See LOS ANGELES RECORD (February 20, 1922). Peavey expressed the same opinion to the Hearst reporters who abducted him. See SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER (February 21, 1922), and CHICAGO AMERICAN (February 20 and 21, 1922, reprinted in TAYLOROLOGY 22 and 23). During that abduction, he also told of the argument he witnessed between Taylor and Normand. See LOS ANGELES HERALD (February 20, 1922). That argument was hinted at in Mabel Normand's own statement to reporters. See LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (February 15, 1922, reprinted in TAYLOROLOGY 6). In Peavey's 1930 statement to the press he said he had no knowledge as to what the argument was about. See LOS ANGELES RECORD (January 7, 1930). [40] From the context of the article it is clear King thought Charlotte Shelby, dressed in man's clothing, was the person who murdered Taylor.********************************************************************************************************************************************************** Back issues of Taylorology are available on the Web at any of the following: http://www.angelfire.com/az/Taylorology/ http://www.etext.org/Zines/ASCII/Taylorology/ http://www.uno.edu/~drif/arbuckle/Taylorology/ Full text searches of back issues can be done at http://www.etext.org/Zines/ For more information about Taylor, see WILLIAM DESMOND TAYLOR: A DOSSIER (Scarecrow Press, 1991)*****************************************************************************
