Interview with George Lasher

In 1923, actress Margaret Gibson was accused of criminal activity against George Lasher (see TAYLOROLOGY 85). The following interview with Lasher unfortunately had some illegible portions in the newspaper microfilm. Thanks to Richard Rosenberg for providing this clipping.

November 5, 1923 Ted LeBerthon LOS ANGELES RECORD "Sure I Fell for Her"

"Badger" Victim Talks

"Did I fall for Patricia Palmer?" George Lasher, tall, rawboned proprietor of the Burbank Electric shop, whom the pretty actress is charged with blackmailing to the extent of $1155, grinned squintingly and of good- humored pale blue eyes, then scratched his sandy red thatched cerebellum ruminatively. Glancing with humorous shiftiness at his pretty little dark-haired wife, who was blushing furiously as she hovered uncomfortably near, Lasher spurted into impetuous frankness: "This Patricia Palmer--or Margaret Gibson--'ud make a smarter guy tham I am fall. Why, sure I fell. You know what a feller's after when a dame with eyes like that"--Lasher rolled his own--"hooks him." He elucidated upon the fact that he didn't mind being trimmed, that he'd a-never "squawked"--even though she had separated him from over a thousand "iron men." "I'd a-taken my medicine," he nodded stoically, "and I didn't say anything about the girl until the government agents had made their investigation--which I didn't have anything to do with. "Mrs. Gibson--the girl's ma--knew I was a married man--and she smiled her consent to her girl and I stepping out in their auto. "But me for my little wife here from now on--she's my boss now and I won't do anything again to hurt her--yeah, we're sittin' pretty, now, and we're goin' to be happy, ain't we?" Mrs. Lasher forced a febrile smile. "Every guy lets his foot slip once or twice," Lasher rambled on, "but there's no use being a glutton for punishment. "When a pretty gal gets sweet on ye, an' you're married, make up your mind that she's got your bankrool covered with her good eye. "She took me like Grant took Richmond--for eight hundred, for two hundred and eighty and for seventy-five. That's eleven hundred and fifty- five hard-earned ducats. "But down in Tijuana I got wised-up to her. I begin to figure a couple o' guys was in on the game with her. You know the fellers I mean," he laughed shakily. "So I said to myself, 'George, get ready to duck out.' "How did I come to after they slipped the knockout drops in my drink? Well, I never exactly passed out. I felt myself slipping. They already had my check for a thousand following Miss Palmer, Patricia, Margaret, y' understand, winning the bet that that she could drink me under..."[illegible gap] ...whole affair because he was questioned by Department of Justice Agents Mechan and Connelly, who were investigating a giant blackmail ring. Miss Palmer, alias Gibson, was arrested at the home of her mother, Mrs. Ella Gibson, 2324 North Beechwood Drive, and later released on $2500 bail, with a hearing set for November 8. Lasher was introduced to the girl by Don Osborn, who recently pleaded guilty in Cincinnati, Ohio, along with Ruth Putnam, to charges growing out of an alleged attempt to blackmail John L. Bushnell, banker, of Springfield, Ohio. Osborn, according to the federal investigators, had purchased a home from Patricia Palmer at 2575 Beechwood Drive. From certain sources it was learned that four members of a blackmailing ring were slated for arrest in Los Angeles and San Francisco Monday, with other arrests to follow in other cities of the Unitied States. It is said that in most cases the ring has preyed on wealthy married men through clever and pretty women, trips to Tijuana and threats, finally, of Mann act prosecutions.

[Taylor directed two films at Favorite Players in late 1914 and early 1915. The following article describes the studio at that time. Of particular interest is the brief mention of Bebe Daniels, indicating that she may possibly have played a small role in a film Taylor directed there.]

March 1915 Dick Melbourne [Richard Willis] MOVIE PICTORIAL A Visit to the Favorite Players Studio

"I have got to have room," said Carlyle Blackwell, as I remarked upon the fact that he had two dressing rooms made into one. "I hate to be cramped," and as I sat by his oil stove, for it was very early in the morning and the rains had left the atmosphere damp, I surveyed the rows of clothes neatly hung behind canvas curtains, hats galore and shoes a plenty. Carlyle Blackwell is a proverbial, good and careful dresser and just what his tailor bills come to per month, he would not tell me.--"I do not keep count," he argued, "when I want a new suit I go and get one and I aim to dress all my parts correctly. I am a strong advocate for good clothes on the screen and when anyone tells you that cheap suits register as well as tailored clothes, you can tell him emphatically he is incorrect in his surmise." It is care with details and conscientiousness in his acting and dressing which have made Carlyle Blackwell the undoubted favorite he is today, and false economy either in dress, or in the mounting of a picture has stopped many an actor's career or a concern's progress at a certain unwise point. The director, William D. Taylor, was preparing for an interior scene in the production of "The High Hand," and I noted that he superintended everything to the smallest detail, himself. They form a sharp contrast, Taylor and Blackwell, the latter slim, alert, dark eyed and black haired, the former strong of face with the "Irish" showing in the keen eyes and the long upper lip, big boned and built for strength and tenacity. Taylor was formerly one of the finest actors on the legitimate stage and on the screen and created quite a sensation with his "Captain Alvarez," the six reeler put on by the Vitagraph Company. They make a splendid alliance, and during their pleasant association, Carlyle Blackwell has done better work than ever before, and Taylor has never done anything so good as his direction of "The High Hand," and "The Last Chapter." "Daddy" Springer has surpassed himself in the furnishings of the beautiful set and Daddy deserves a word to himself for he is quite a character. He is devoted to Blackwell, and when the latter went East with the Famous Players to act in "The Spitfire," Springer worked for another firm, but he told Carlyle that the moment he heard he was coming back, he would quit, and he did. He was waiting for his late boss at the station and there was never any question in his mind that he would do anything else but work for the newly formed Favorite Players Company, and he is part and parcel of it. Springer has a persuasive way with him and can coax anything from a broom handle to a sarcophagus from a peasant or a millionaire, a barn or a museum. They know he will always return what he borrows in good condition and woe betide the property man or artist who puts so much as a scratch on any article he brings into the studio. The scene being ready, Blackwell and the others appearing in it, were duly called. Douglas Gerrard was one of them and Douglas is another Irishman with the tell-tale lip and black curly hair, and oh, the ready tongue of him, he has an answer ready for one all the time, and he can argue the leg off an iron pot. With it all, he is a brilliant actor and an excellent foil to Blackwell, and he is always scrupulously dressed and is terribly worried if he finds a hair on his coat or a crease out of place. Gerrard did good work for the Kalem and Majestic Companies, and was well known on the legitimate stage before he essayed picture acting. Johnny Sheehan was ready for his part. ANOTHER Irishman and another witty one too. Johnny has a curious drawl and tells so many funny stories that he has to be admonished and subdued at times--subdued for about two minutes. He is a character actor and an artist of make-up and a valuable member of the company. Bill Brunton is another stand-by, and if William had only been born with a few more inches atop of him, he would be a big figure on the pantomimic stage, and he is regarded as one of the best screen actors, as it is. There was but one girl, and a little one at that. Neva Gerber is so small and so pretty that she looks almost out of place with all the men, and she has the only woman's part of consequence in the present photoplay. Neva has worked with Carlyle before, during the time he was a member of the Kalem Company, with whom he made such a name for himself, and Neva was also with Edwin August and acted opposite her present director when he was acting and producing for the Balboa Company at Long Beach. To get away from the Irish element somewhat, the company have a clever little Englishman to turn the crank of the camera, for Homer Scott has earned his place by his truly wonderful photography and his past record. Scott was imprisoned in Mexico for some time and only escaped death by a miracle. He is fond of adventure and would risk it all again, only there is a Mrs. Scott who objects and thinks that her hubby takes risks enough with the ordinary motion picture concern, so Scott lives in an apartment house and works faithfully and well and gets much credit for his camera ingenuity. Then there is Henry Kernan, who assists his director and who also takes papas and merchants and parts which he does with due dignity and aplomb. Harry is a useful man, having been architect in days gone by. The work at the Favorite Players studio goes along very smoothly. Taylor knows just what he wants and has the ability to get it without too much effort; he has experienced artists who do not need too much directing, and in Carlyle Blackwell he has about the easiest acting star in the game. Blackwell is highly intelligent and grasps any situation readily, and is never above helping a less resourceful actor who plays with him. The company is just a happy family. To those who think that this acting is mere play, I would say that every member of the cast ate breakfast before seven o'clock in order to be made up and ready for work at eight-thirty, and that after a brief luncheon they worked until six o'clock and then met in the city later on to take a night scene, finally getting home at eleven o'clock with a call for the morrow at eight-thirty again. Of course, the work is not always so prolonged, but these good people work long hours and are not guided by the time clock and aim to take advantage of every little bit of sun there is, especially at this time of year (February) when the rains come along to interfere with picture taking. A visit to the Favorite Players studio is not complete without calling in on Mrs. Daniels, who manages the office and most of the company for that matter. She is a "dear"; she is the mother of the whole lot of them and hears all their trials and their joys, and she is not an ancient person at that--she is just one of those charming ladies who readily bear others burdens and who help to make light of troubles. She has a big little daughter Bebe, who is going to make a fine actress--she is seen in the Favorite Players films occasionally. The Favorite Players Company is bound to make good pictures where such excellent spirit prevails, they MAKE their work play by force of good will, and the fun they have with each other, and Carlyle Blackwell is as big a "kid" as any of them and bigger than most of them. I doubt whether he will ever be an old-man, and Sheehan and Gerrard will be as youthful as he when they meet in after years to talk over all the good times they had when they were acting for the screen.

Hi...just wanted to let you know how much I am enjoying Taylorology. I have been fascinated by the Taylor case since 1986, when I bought "A Cast of Killers". Say what you will about that book, it certainly sparked my interest! I have been trying to get on the Internet for quite a while... I finally found a local provider that I like, and one of the first things I did was to locate the Taylorology back issues, and have been downloading them one or two at a time...They're absolutely splendid...you do a terrific job.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I really enjoy your Taylorology newsletter and anxiously await each new issue.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I came across Taylorology recently and am quite captivated by it. Every since reading A Cast Of Killers the mystery caught my fancy. I am, however, quite impressed at the depth of reporting in each of your issues...It is amazing to see everything from Movie Weekly to just about any publication that reported the case and the "characters."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I have just discovered "Taylorology", and can't wait to finish reading the back issues.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I've long (no pun intended) been a fan of Taylorology, and I'm sure you must be proud both of the high quality of the material you put out and the fact that you are one of the pioneers of the world wide web! Your page was out there before most people even had the notion of accessing www information... Please keep up the great work on Taylorology.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I'd like to thank you for "Taylorology." I discovered it about a year ago, and I have been fascinated and completely engaged by the story since then.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

This is a truly marvelous thing you are doing, making so much material available on the Internet.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I just wanted to write and tell you how much I'm enjoying the back issues of Taylorology. I find this case to be one of the more fascinating in the annals of American true crime history.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Just downloaded Taylorology 40, and am enjoying all the interviews with the stars. Also wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed the two issues about Wallace Reid. I have wanted to read more about him, and was going to ask if you "take requests", and there he was!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

What a wonderful site you have. I find old Hollywood a fascinating subject.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I recently downloaded a whack of Arbuckle material from your Taylorology site: Issue 28, April 1995. What a fantastic collection!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Just wanted to let you know how much I enjoy 'Taylorology'.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

They call the internet the information highway, but who would have thought you could find information on a murdered director most people have never heard of? I saw a show on CBS about the murder about 12 years ago which prompted me to write a college research paper on this man. Finding any information on him at all was difficult. Over the years since, I have been intrigued with any talk about his works or murder...I am looking forward to going through each Taylorology and thank you for your hard work for this site.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I am newly Cyberized, and one of my delights has been finding Taylorology on the www. I'm a great admirer of your William Desmond Taylor book compilation and commentary, and I know I'm going to enjoy exploring all the individual issues.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I've been meaning to thank you for your wonderful work on Taylorology -- I just don't know how you do it!!...keep up the good work!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I downloaded your latest edition of TAYLOROLOGY with the Chaplin material and read it and was truly impressed...--I was amazed to encounter so many Chaplin articles in TAYLOROLOGY which I haven't seen before (including many of the secondary book sources)

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Do you do all this by myself or do you have help?...I can't believe all this stuff is free!!!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

What an impressive collection this is. I came across Taylorology while researching Fatty Arbuckle. Nice job.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I'm just stunned that you've been able to churn out some 1,700 pages on one scandal and show no signs of running out of material!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how much I enjoy Taylorology.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Was delighted to stumble across your wonderful newsletter. I have been fascinated with the Taylor case since I first read about it in Hollywood Babylon...keep up the good work.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I looked around your Taylor web site and you certainly have an abundance of spectacular research there.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I just wanted to thank you for all the info on William Desmond Taylor-- I had no idea that such a thing as "Taylorology" was out there, until I searched the 'Net yesterday. The WDT murder has always interested me.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Thank you for compiling Taylorology. You've done an incredible job.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Great Work!!!! I thought I was the only person in this world obsessed with the Taylor murder of 1922. This subject, and more particularly, the result Taylor's murder had on two silent movies most underrated actresses (Minter and Normand) have intrigued me since I first learned of the murder seventeen years ago.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I enjoy the context and historic perspective created by the non-Taylor related issues as much as the issues concerning the murder.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I stumbled across Taylorology during my Internet search on Mary Miles Minter...please accept my gratitude and appreciation for a job well done!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I am a Mabel Normand fan and have been intrigued with the William Desmond Taylor case for years, as well. I just wanted to say how impressed I am with your newsletter--what an awesome resource!!..."Taylorology" was one of the first sites I found on the web (I've only been on line about a month), and was totally blown away by it... I really admire the fact that you have made this material available online. It was certainly a magnanimous gesture and is most appreciated. Thanks.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I am currently doing research for a screenwriter who is fashioning a screenplay concerning the Taylor murder....Let me compliment you on your superb site and its administration. I have been able to get more information here in several hours than I have gleaned from the various halls of records and newspaper archives in the last few months.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I have been enjoying reading Taylorology on the Internet. What a great undertaking! I hope you enjoy it as much as your readers do.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Congratulations on your "Taylorogy" but, pray tell, where and when did you do all the research?... Where DID you get all this material?...Congratulations again. It is great!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I stumbled on your web site today through AMC. It's wonderful! Ever since "A Cast of Killers" came out, I've been a closet fanatic of the silent Hollywood era...I really appreciate the length of the newsletter and its completeness. So many times you'll read 'excerpts' but not an entire document....Just wanted to say hello and thanks for the great reading!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Your Taylorology list is the best I've seen anywhere.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I just finished reading Juanita Hansen's own story of her drug addiction. It was one of the most emotional stories I have ever read. Our drug problem hasn't changed in 75 years! I'm a huge silent film fan and your web site is fantastic and much appreciated.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Love your site & pages!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I have very much enjoyed the reprints in Taylorology and find it one of the most informative film history sites on the Internet.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I enjoyed very much the web site info on Olive Thomas, of particular interest to me for several years.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Just wanted to tell you that I enjoy Taylorology a great deal. I just discovered it last week, and it is not only educational but a lot of fun. I love the Chaplin references and interviews especially.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I would just like to compliment you on your zine Taylorology; as a silent movie buff I am fascinated with some of the old interviews you have dragged up from the archives--keep up the good work.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

You don't know me, but I just wanted to write a gushing fan letter because I've just started reading Taylorology and am completely sucked in. I print off two issues every lunch hour (don't tell my boss!) and read it as soon as possible.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Great site!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I find the information you have been researching extremely amazing. Congratulations!!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I have enjoyed Taylorology immensely.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Taylorology" is a fantastic resource and was an invaluable help to me.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Keep up the good work, it's great to know I am not the only person fascinated with this.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I am very impressed by your work on William Desmond Taylor.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I have been fascinated by Taylorology for days now, it's a great read. Congratulations.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I thought I was the only one facinated with the murder of Mr. Taylor...Thank you for creating this wonderful site and for your hard work and effort.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I just wanted to drop you a line to say thank you for all of the wonderful information in Taylorology. I am absolutely hooked, starting off with "A Cast of Killers" and now reading so much more. Thank you, it is addicting and fascinating.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I really look forward to each issue of Taylorology. I don't know what I'll do if you ever run out of things to write.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Just found your Taylorology Web Page -- Wow! All you ever wanted to know about Hollywood's most fascinating scandal and then some.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I have recently discovered "Taylorology" and find them fascinating.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I am a regular reader of your newsletter, "Taylorology" which has been a constant source of interesting information. In particular, I was impressed with the issue devoted to the "Life and Death of Olive Thomas."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoy reading your TAYLOROLGY magazines. About one month ago, I went on-line at work and looked up William Desmond Taylor, not expecting to find much of anything. Imagine my delight when I clicked onto your web site. I have had an un-ending fascination for WDT for over 20 years. (Yes, I bought both A CAST OF KILLERS and A DEED OF DEATH as soon as they were available.) I have downloaded and printed out each edition of your magazine (they take up 5 1.5" loose-leaf notebooks) and am jumping back and forth between editions...I look forward to reading future editions.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

You have a truly great site.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Thanks for all your issues of "Taylorology." I truly enjoy reading them, and appreciate all the research you've done. The Taylor murder is a fascinating study of Hollywood, politics, and social issues.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Hello! I recently discovered Taylorology. Believe it or not, I was trying to find something on WDT and had no idea that such a thing existed. What a great find...Just wanted to let you know how much I am enjoying your efforts. Thanks!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I talked with a friend today and expressed my awe for what you are doing with Taylorology -- given that the curtain has probably fallen on any revelation knowledge connected with the drama of Taylor's death. I find myself feeling sad that it is so, but I read on with determination and enjoyment. I read somewhere that we never see things as they really are, but, rather, we see things as we really are. I have found a new spirit of the romance that flourished in the 1900 - 1930 era and it has changed me. Slightly, imperceptibly, but as I really am. Thank you for what is obviously a labor of love.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Hi. I just discovered your web site and spent five hours reading some of your back issues. Thank you for presenting the incredible information, most of it not available anywhere else.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Thank you for having set up such an interesting site!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I had to write and tell you how THRILLED I was to see YOU on "Mysteries & Scandals", Monday night!!... Keep up the magnificent work on Taylorology, I always look so forward to each month's entry!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Just thought I would let you know that I really enjoy the Taylorology site. It is such an interesting story. You have done yeoman work, congratulations ...I look forward to each new issue.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

It's a pleasure to take a moment to say hello and to compliment you on the work you've done with "Taylorology." The new issue's another winner!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I enjoy reading Taylorology for its research into the mystery of Taylor's death and also the for many other subjects and players from the silent era that it covers.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

What a great web site! I thought I was one of the few people who were actually interested in Hollywood in the 20s -- thank you for all the information!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Just wanted to compliment you on your ezine -- It was a delight to find SOMETHING on the web about Wallace Reid, one of my long-time "heart-throbs".

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I found your news letter fascinating. I remember reading of the Taylor murder in my mother's copy of HOLLYWOOD BABYLON as a child.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Have been reading away and enjoying myself with TAYLOROLOGY; what a labor for you, but what an interesting spectrum of information about Hollywood in the era. Many thanks from providing such interesting material.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

As a student of history and a former resident of "Filmland," I have spent many months fascinated by your research on the murder of William Desmond Taylor. Well done!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

It's another great issue!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I read your issues of Taylorology all the time. They are incomparable.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I ran across your Taylorology and think its really great.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Taylorology" is a fantastic site! I am amazed that you are able to come up with so much previously unpublished and very rare information every month. It's a goldmine for anyone interested in Taylor or in general information about Hollywood in the 20s. I was especially delighted to see the rare Buster Keaton interviews.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Just wanted to let you know what a great job you are doing with the Taylorology site.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I have thoroughly enjoyed your site and think it is a tremendously well researched and entertaining contribution to this fascinating subject.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Bravo, I thought that I was the only one who cared about the Taylor Murder, but when I found your zine on the net through a search I was so happy. You have dedicated a large part of your life to William D. Taylor, you are to be commended and praised. Bless you for the fine work so far.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I enjoyed discovering your Taylorology. What a great site, and so much primary-source information.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I stumbled across Taylorology some time ago and found a wealth of information there. It's really a great resource!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I've spent yet another afternoon scanning issues of "Taylorology" and wanted to drop you a line to say THANKS for compiling such a wealth of information. Whenever I stop by your site, it seems I can never leave until a couple of hours have ticked by!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I've just revived a passing interest in the Taylor case, thanks to your wonderful work.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Thanks again and again for your great contributions to film history and the wonderful depth and breadth of your work on Taylor in particular.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

What a fascinating web site!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I just wanted to let you know that I found "Taylorology" fascinating... Keep up the good work and I will certainly bookmark the site and return to it often.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Let me first begin with how happy I was to find Taylorology on the Net!.. I have been absorbed in Taylor's death since 1994...No one else I have mentioned this to has the intensity towards this subject as I have. I think we must be a special breed!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I had no idea you had a website! I bought your book on the Taylor case years ago and am digging around in your online goldmine....Thank you for taking the time to research a case so important to our societal perception of the world surrounding silent films.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I thought I would drop you an informal note to thank you for all your amazing research on William Desmond Taylor.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I have fortuitously stumbled across Taylorology, and I think it is absolutely wonderful! I am amazed at the wealth of information you have gathered on the subject; it must have taken years. You certianly have cleared up a lot of the errors I had previously accepted as fact (having read "A Cast of Killers", and other material). There is so much to read; I am limiting myself to two issues a night so as to prolong the pleasure! My hat is off to you, sir.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Recently, I stumbled across your Taylorology website, and I must say that the issues are most informative and so compelling....Thank you for providing such a comprehensive look into the mystique and wonder that was old Hollywood.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Taylorology is, in my opinion, one of the finest ongoing publications on the web.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I want to thank you for the creation and upkeep of your website for TAYLOROLOGY. I am a huge cinaste and history buff with a special interest in this case.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

You have the most extraordinary resource of the silent film era that I have ever seen.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I just discovered your site. It is great! I am looking forward to many hours of interest reading your compilations. Thanks for your obvious hard work!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

While growing up in the Sixties my friends were into the Beatles, I preferred the Silent Screen stars, needless to say, I was alone in my pursuit of the long ago era. I have pursued my interest all these years, reading every book, watching all available silent film and now with the internet a vast source of information with Taylorology being one of my favorite sites... I have just spent my New Year reading the introduction of Gibson/Palmer to the Taylor murder case, I felt compelled to write you and thank you for the continuation and insights into this fascinating story.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I have read each and every issue of Taylorology -- with increasing awe. Not only because of the discussion of the murder itself, but also due to the amount of original material presented, covering the careers of nearly everyone involved. This is film history at its absolute best.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

It seemed the perfect time to let you know how much and how useful I find Taylorology. I also hope I appreciate how much time and work must go into maintaining and updating such a large project. So... a heartfelt thanks for providing such a wonderful site.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I just "stumbled" onto your website today and must tell you that I am in awe of the incredible amount of research you have done on this case...Keep up the good work. I am still dazed by this website.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Your newsletter is fabulous. We have learned a lot form each edition.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

...I found the Taylorology site fascinating, reading the interviews with my great grand mother were fascinating, especially where my grandmother was mentioned!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I saw the specials on "City Confidential" and "Perfect Crimes" regarding William Desmond Taylor. Kudos to you! They were both very enjoyable. Thank you for including another "Capt. Billy's Whiz Bang" article in the latest issue. If you can scrounge up any more, please publish them.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Been following your excellent website for a long, long time now. Great stuff! More, more, more. Keep it coming!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I've been visiting your site literally for years, and have obtained tons of information that I've used in my research...I love your site.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Hi. I just discovered your web site/newsletter and I love it! Your dedication and comprehensiveness are amazing.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I spent quite some time last night at the Taylorology site...unsolved mysteries about interesting people are something of an obsession of mine -- so I understand and applaud yours!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Amazing site. I am really impressed.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

You have a wonderful and informative website. I'll refer to it often.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

My interest in the Taylor case, and in the life of Mary Miles Minter in particular, began recently after seeing the A&E "City Confidential" episode detailing the Taylor murder. This prompted me to do a search online for items of interest pertaining to the case, which led me to your Taylorology site and e-magazine. I have read with considerable interest each issue you've posted...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I want to commend you for this wonderful site and congratulate you on offering an outstanding collection of historical information of the era of Mr. Taylor. I find myself returning to your web site from time to time to browse the many aspects of the mystery.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I just came across your website on WDT. Good work. I have been a fan of the case since I first read about it in this book called "Fallen Angels". A few years later I read Kirkpatrick's "A Cast of Killers". I was really enthralled. As the years passed I forgot about the case, until today. The History Channel ran a segment on it this afternoon and it rekindled that old interest from many years ago. I decided to look WDT on the www and I came across your site. It will take me weeks to go through all of it but from what I have seen I like it already. Keep up the good work.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I wanted to inform you that I have read through most of Taylorology and cannot praise you enough for the time and effort that went into each issue. The depth of your knowledge and resources is staggering. I thought I know enough of the case (having read "A Cast of Killers" and being familiar with famous murder cases); now I see I was completely misled. Again, my thanks for such an entertaining and information website.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

William Taylor's murder has been a curiosity to me ever since I cataloged a book on it about 10 years ago. Yesterday I found your website Taylorology and have started reading the articles...Thank you for such an informative website.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I love Taylorology,...I have fallen in love I think with Mary Miles Minter :)

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I have to express my great gratitude for all your work on Taylorogy...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Great work on your documents. Lots of work putting all that information together. How did you do it all? ...Thanks for all the info.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I have just seen your web site and I think it's outstanding.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Taylorology is a wonderful mirror on a fascinating time in American history. Thanks for all of the work. Do you have any idea how many readers you have lured into this addiction? ...Your work on Taylorology and your research into the morals and mores of the era is a goldmine.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Your site is excellent. What a wonderful idea of yours.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I've been interested in the Taylor case for a while and I think your research is superb.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I don't want to take up too much of your time, but I just wanted to thank you for all of your efforts with "Taylorology". I am so enjoying reading the wealth of material, not just on Taylor, but on some of the other people that you feature. I just finished reading about Olive Thomas, and now I am off for more reading. Television is being turned on less and less. Thanks again.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Congratulations on your fine e-zine (if that's the right word). I just discovered it a few days ago, quite by accident. I have been interested in the Taylor mystery since about 1983, and have read just about everything I could find on the subject.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Your work on Taylor murder is bravo! bravo!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I want to thank you for your fantastic dedication, and for making so many fugitive sources available to all. Please keep up your valuable work.
