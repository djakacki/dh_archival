***************************************************************************** What is TAYLOROLOGY? TAYLOROLOGY is a newsletter focusing on the life and death of William Desmond Taylor, a top Paramount film director in early Hollywood who was shot to death on February 1, 1922. His unsolved murder was one of Hollywood's major scandals. This newsletter will deal with: (a) The facts of Taylor's life; (b) The facts and rumors of Taylor's murder; (c) The impact of the Taylor murder on Hollywood and the nation. Primary emphasis will be given toward reprinting, referencing and analyzing source material, and sifting it for accuracy. Reader input is welcome, in the form of "Letters to the Editor," short articles, and contributed source material.
***************************************************************************** Why Taylor's Servant Thought Mabel Normand was the Killer

Henry Peavey was certain Mabel killed Taylor for the following reasons. Bear in mind that Peavey was illiterate (undoubtedly the main reason Taylor hired him--after the bad experience with Sands he wanted a valet who wouldn't be reading his mail, snooping in his private papers, etc.), so Peavey knew almost nothing of the material appearing in the press about the murder--all he really had to go by was his own senses: what he saw, heard, and felt.

1. On the murder night, "Howard Fellows, Taylor's chauffeur, says he was to call Mr. Taylor at 7:30 o'clock. He declares that he called him by phone at that time and got no answer. Twice more he called, with the same result; then he drove the car around into Alvarado Street, parked it near the court and rang the front doorbell. The lights of the house were lit, but no one answered the door. The chauffeur put the car in the garage and went home."[1] Fellows likewise told Peavey that his first unanswered telephone call to Taylor's had been at 7:30, which was during Mabel Normand's visit.[2] Peavey knew and trusted Fellows, and had no reason to doubt his word, whereas he did not know Davis (Normand's chauffeur), who was Mabel Normand's primary alibi witness. For all Peavey knew, Davis could be lying to protect Mabel Normand, and Taylor could have been dead at 7:30. Why else would the telephone call at 7:30 not be answered? Mabel said that she and Taylor only stood at the curb talking for a few minutes before she departed at 7:45.

2. During his kidnapping by Hearst reporters, Peavey described an incident that had taken place during a previous visit of Mabel's: (Quoting Peavey) "Some time before this, however, this same actress came over one night and, after looking around, picked up a scissors, pulled down three or four of her pictures from the wall and sat right down on the floor. She then began to cut up her pictures into small bits. Taylor noticed her and said, 'What's the idea?' So she answered, 'I guess I can cut up my own pictures if I want to, can't I?' and he said he guessed she could. I don't know why she cut up her own pictures, but I suppose she had some reason." [3] The act of cutting up her pictures did not seem, to Peavey, to be the act of a stable person.

3. Because of strong circumstantial evidence, Peavey was certain that Mabel had visited Taylor's home on Tuesday night, the night before the murder. (Quoting Peavey) "...She was there the night before the murder and again the night that Mr. Taylor was killed. I know that she was with Mr. Taylor on Tuesday night before the Wednesday that he was killed, because she told me so. Wednesday night when she came in Mr. Taylor asked her to have some pudding. She said while I was in the room that she did not care for any pudding that night, but had enjoyed the pudding that she had the night before. Then I learned for the first time what had happened to some pudding that I had left in the ice box on Tuesday night and that was gone Wednesday morning when I arrived at the Taylor home." [4] That Tuesday visit of Mabel Normand was confirmed by one of the residents of the apartment complex, who saw Taylor and Normand leave together that night. [5] Yet in her post-murder interviews and statements to the investigators, Mabel steadfastly denied having been with Taylor on Tuesday night. Peavey's probable thoughts: If Mabel lied about that visit, she may be lying about much more.

4. The Taylor home was ordinarily a very quiet and tranquil place. Peavey had only seen one person shatter that peace; one person raise her voice to Taylor and argue with him; one person fail to treat Taylor with respect and consideration at all times. The most recent outburst took place less than an hour before Taylor was killed. What Peavey called an "argument" between Mabel and Taylor was referred to by Mabel in one of her statements to the press, recalling her last visit with Taylor: (Quoting Mabel) "I said to Mr. Taylor, 'Oh, why does your company always produce the stories that are my favorites. Why I would gladly have played in "The Little Minister" or "The Morals of Marcus" because I love them so.' "It seems curious that part of our last talk should turn on my little disappointment, which seemed so important then, as to be almost a little tragedy of my own, when this great tragedy of Mr. Taylor's life, and mine, too, was to follow right after." [6] Mabel had a well-known reputation for being feisty and profane. If her "disappointment" truly "seemed so important" at the time, she certainly would have strongly expressed her feelings to Taylor regarding this "tragedy." Peavey called it an argument; it was certainly more than just a friendly discussion. Of course, it was probably not an argument in the sense of a heated exchange of words--it was one sided and not taken seriously by Taylor. It was also defused when Peavey entered the room and Mabel was amused at Peavey's attire. I would imagine Mabel's words to have been something like this: ("Damn it, Billy, why is it that every time a really good story comes along Lasky's grabs it first? Just look at The Little Minister and The Morals of Marcus--you know goddamned well that either of those would have been just perfect for me--admit it! But what chance does one little girl like me have when competing against a giant fucking corporation like Lasky's? It's not fair, Billy! It's just not fair! You're supposed to be my friend-- why don't you do something about it? You know how shitty story material almost wrecked my career when I was with Goldwyn! You bastards at Paramount released over 100 films last year--you gobble up all the good stories like they were peanuts! How's about leaving something for me, huh, Billy?") The profanity which was a normal part of Mabel's conversation undoubtedly led Peavey to believe the tirade was more serious than it was, but to him it certainly was an argument: "The woman was doing most of the talking. She was mad." [7]

5. Peavey told Woolwine about the argument he had heard. (He did not know what it was about, only that Mabel was giving Taylor hell about something.) Woolwine told Peavey to keep quiet about the argument and to tell no one: "Mr. Woolwine has told me not to talk to nobody." [8] This led Peavey to believe that the argument must have been very important evidence--indeed, it burned at his conscience until he came clean about it in 1930. So Peavey knew there was a cover-up designed to protect Mabel; if his statement had been silenced, how much other evidence against Mabel had also been covered up? "(question by a reporter) You told Dr. Filben that when the district attorney was questioning you, you said repeatedly 'Why do you pick on me? You know who killed Taylor.' Is that right?" "(answer by Peavey) Yes, it sure is...They made me think, at the time Mr. Taylor was killed, that if I didn't keep my mouth shut about this quarrel and get out of Los Angeles that they might accuse me of the murder." [9]

Viewed from the perspective of those five points, Peavey's certainty about Mabel Normand's guilt is very easy to understand.
***************************************************************************** 1929 Interview with Charlotte Shelby December 26, 1929 A. M. Rochlen LOS ANGELES EXAMINER

In a remarkable interview, given exclusively to the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, mother of Mary Miles Minter, last night for the first time revealed hitherto unknown phases of the William Desmond Taylor murder case. From the wealth of memories so closely associated with the career of her talented daughter she brought forth details that shed a new light on the many investigations that sought to unravel the tangled threads of the murder of the film director -- a case famous the world over. "The time for action has come. I'm not going to sit idly and be a target for base rumors and vicious innuendo. there must be some justice in this world -- even for a helpless woman." Breaking a silence of more than seven eventful years, Mrs. Shelby, one of the dramatic and ever-interesting figures of the Taylor case, thus struck back at the endless chain of "whispers and theories" linking her, as well as others, in the events of that baffling mystery. Of Mary Miles Minter, who was a film star under Taylor's direction, she had little to say. What here is disclosed would remain forever in her own heart, she said, were it not for the rumors, reports and insinuations that are making her life a dreadful dream. Desiring only to be left alone, Mrs. Shelby now feels that she must cut through the web of whispers and suspicions to bring to an end the repetitions of her name in connection with the case. And she wants to serve notice that every recourse of law will be brought to bear to stop unwarranted bantering of her name and to force those who have used it to come out in the open. "I have made complete statements to the proper authorities in the past and I stand ready to do it again if it will help in a sincere and honest effort to solve the mystery of Mr. Taylor's death," Mrs. Shelby said in the interview. "But somewhere, somehow, this thing has got to stop. I demand it. We cannot go through life like this -- I and my daughter, Margaret. We are not hiding from anyone one anything. All we ask is to be left alone, and somebody has got to help us fight this terrible thing." For the purpose of an earnest and legitimate investigation, Mrs. Shelby revealed for the first time to THE EXAMINER last night that -- She was not in love with William Desmond Taylor. She did not make threats against the famous director. She did not go to Taylor's bungalow at 404B South Alvarado Street at an early morning hour several weeks before the murder, armed with a revolver. She did not, shortly before the murder, purchase a gun and practice with it. "I know that some of these things, with many vicious details added, had been whispered around," Mrs. Shelby said. "How most of them originated, no one knows. Some, I'm sure, were spread by a person formerly in my employ. I know that person and I know the motive. At the proper time and place I shall make known this motive, but in the meantime I am interested in just this: "I want to find out who circulates these rumors. I want to get definite information of definite statements against me, and then I am going to take definite action to the limit of my ability and the law." Mrs. Shelby's blue eyes lost some of their softness as she spoke. Only a few minutes before she came into the room to greet the visitor. Attired in a soft, clinging Viennese gown of golden brown, with brown suede shoes to match, she sat near the window of her charming apartment in a court that looked like a corner of some far-away nook in old Granada. Outside Christmas crowds and laden automobiles moved back and forth. Margaret Shelby Fillmore, always a close pal and companion of her mother, sat nearby. The two had but recently returned from Europe. France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. Paris, London, Vienna -- art museums and Florence -- and then all the crash and cruel reverberations of the old Taylor case. "We arrived in California November 17. For more than three years we lived in Europe. You know, there are many things we do not discuss with the outside world. There are many sorrows one must always bear alone or with those who are very near and close. "My daughter and I (to Mary Miles Minter, Mrs. Shelby never alluded as "my daughter") traveled and saw everything that was beautiful in old Europe, but now we are back -- and to all this." As Mrs. Shelby talked, framed against the deep window and the dazzling white walls of the courtyard, there flashed before the interviewer another occasion, almost eight years ago, when Mrs. Shelby was an actress in a drama in which Mary Miles Minter was playing the leading part. It was in the artistic living room of their home, on North Hobart boulevard, in February 1922. William Desmond Taylor, a man of mystery and romance, a leading figure in the motion picture world, was murdered in his home a few nights before. One by one several beautiful women -- names known throughout the world -- were brought into the case. And Mary Miles Minter, young, vivacious, and then at the height of her artistic career, was one of these. Mary, her face like a Greek profile of exquisite marble, sat on a couch and told of her last visit with Taylor -- in the darkened chamber of the undertaking parlors. She had gone there alone to place a beautiful dark red rose on the body of the man who was her director, friend, ideal. And Mrs. Shelby, close by, listened to the story and watched over Mary. But yesterday, as the brilliant Christmas afternoon was changing into evening, it was a different story. "Yes, I remember that night, nearly eight years ago," Mrs. Shelby replied, and paused. "I want to forget it. Of Mary I shall have nothing to say. She is in good hands and can take care of herself, I'm sure. "In those days my whole life was wrapped up in her. It was my work. Now I must fight for vindication. I've had enough of this, and I am going to ask that they put an end to the case once and for all." Throughout the entire discussion Mrs. Shelby was careful not to express any opinion on who killed Taylor. "Mr. Taylor is dead. My daughter Margaret and I are still alive. We must be protected and not crushed by this gossip. "That's why," she continued, "the truth must be revealed, the truth must be spoken, the truth must be printed. "Of course I have heard the dastardly whisperings about me and my connection with the case. I have heard them all -- that I was in love with Mr. Taylor, that I owned a gun and used to practice on a target a short time before the murder, that I went to Mr. Taylor's apartment early one morning searching for Mr. Taylor and threatening him with death, that I had made many other threats, and so on and on. "Each and every one of these rumors and whisperings is ridiculous. "Let us take them one by one and see," she declared. "I did have a gun." "It was given to me by a jeweler friend of ours in Santa Barbara, way back in 1916. That was a long time before Mr. Taylor was killed. "We were living in Santa Barbara. I was Mary's business manager. I had to read the stories for her pictures, work on the scenarios, watch over her clothes, the cast, everything. "We lived alone. No men folks in the household. Our friend brought the gun to the house one night. He said I must keep it. "'But I don't know how to use it. I never held one in my hand before,' I told him. "'Well, let's learn,' he replied." Mrs. Shelby smiled. "You know, this really bears a strange element of humor, now that I look back on it. "We went out to some open spaces and I took this gun in my right hand. It was a pretty little thing -- had a pearl handle and all that. I pointed the gun at something or other, shut my eyes and pulled hard. The thing went 'boom' and threw my arm back. "I did that several times in succession. That was all." "Still, they call it target practice." Mrs. Shelby said she did not remember what had become of the gun. She says she has no recollection of bringing it back to Los Angeles when the household moved from Santa Barbara. "That much for target practicing," she declared. "Now about that visit to Mr. Taylor's house. "To understand it, I must take you back a few years. I must ask you to keep in mind the fact that Mary was at the height of her career, was making big pictures. We had been in New York. I negotiated new contracts. There were trips and conferences and all that. Many, many details that play no part here, except incidentally as they relate to the contacts made with a former employee for whom I sent to New York and who later figured in the visit story. "We were back in California. Mary's contract originally called for pictures to be made in New York. One day Mr. Adolph Zukor held a conference with us. It was decided that climatic conditions were better out here on the Coast for the type of picture Mary was making. So we came out. "Mr. Taylor was Mary's director. "About the time of this much-discussed visit Mary bought a new car. It was a big, fast roadster, and Mary liked speed. She used to go out, tearing along the roads at 60 and 70 miles an hour. I was her mother and it worried me -- naturally. "We were living on Fremont place. At that time of the year there was lots of fog at nights. "One night Mary did not come home to dinner. We waited and waited. She did not call. We began to worry. "Perhaps she went to dinner at someone's house, it was suggested to me. We tried to reassure ourselves of this, but somehow I kept worrying about getting no telephone call and about that big, fast car and the foggy roads. "We began to call up persons at the studio. We called the cameraman and the assistant cameraman. The cameraman, a big, jolly Irishman, was a favorite of Mary's. He was married and had small children. She was fond of children and occasionally stopped at his house. The cameraman told us Mary had not been there. No one could remember seeing her leave the studio. "We thought Mr. Taylor perhaps would know. But we did not have his phone number. No one seemed to know it. "Then we remembered that one day Mary and her grandmother, Juliette B. Miles, went to Mr. Taylor's home for tea. "Chauncey, our chauffeur, drove them, so we called Chauncey and asked him if he knew where Mr. Taylor lived. He said he thought he could find the place but did not know the address. "So we started out, Chauncey, my secretary and I. "We drove around and around. the chauffeur said he knew the neighborhood but was not certain of the exact location. Finally he remembered it. We stopped at the corner of Fourth and Alvarado streets. It was close to midnight then. "Chauncey said he did not know which bungalow was Mr. Taylor's. There were a number of them," Mrs. Shelby went on, making a wide sweep with her right arm. "As I remember it, there were some on the left, some on the right and some bungalows in the back. "I saw a light burning in a window on the right, so I rang the bell, or knocked, I don't remember which. Some one answered and I asked them if they knew where Mr. Taylor lived. They pointed to a house on the left side of the court, the last one in the back. I went there and rang the bell. The house was dark. "Mr. Taylor's voice came from the second story window. "'Who is there?' he asked." "'This is Mrs. Shelby, Mr. Taylor,' I answered. "'I'll be right down,' he replied and in a short time opened the door and asked me to step in. "I entered the room, a sort of combination living and dining room. Mr. Taylor showed much interest. He, too, appeared worried over Mary's absence. Then he suggested some more persons to call. I waited while he used the telephone. "I remember that he stepped into a sort of a telephone room -- an out of the way nook, and called. He talked to an assistant director, I think his name was Frank O'Connor, and he called several others. None had seen Mary or knew where she had gone. "By this time we both were considerably worried. "After some conversation, in which I mentioned my fears of an accident, I left." "'Be sure to call me and let me know if anything had happened,' Mr. Taylor said as he bade me goodbye. I went to our car, where Charlotte Whitney, the secretary, waited for me, and we went home. "I do not now remember the time of this visit. It was not, as has been whispered around, shortly before Mr. Taylor's murder. I did not 'storm' into the house, with a loaded revolver in hand, as has been whispered around. I did not threaten Mr. Taylor, as has been said." Miss Minter, Mrs. Shelby said, came home some time later. "She never told us where she had been that night. We were relieved to learn that there had been no accident and that she was well. "But months later we learned about that trip. Frank Urson, a dear friend of the family, and an old associate from Santa Barbara days, told me that he had run across Mary, driving her big roadster at 55 miles an hour and that he took her in tow and finally sent her home. He told me he feared she would meet with an accident and warned us against her habit of speeding. "Certainly," Mrs. Shelby declared, "this incident is not a hot murder mystery clue. Certainly, had there been anything sinister in that night visit, I would not have taken two witnesses me or made public inquiry for Mr. Taylor's residence. "And yet," Mrs. Shelby went on," some one related this story and some one has been keeping it alive, until today it is one of the endless chains of clues and rumors that keep bobbing up on the least provocation. "What's more," Mrs. Shelby declared, this story, along with all sorts of others, was related to former District Attorney Asa Keyes. "I made a complete statement to Mr. Keyes after he returned from New York. I held back nothing. Why this 'mystery' should be resurrected ever so often, is beyond me." "To the world in general the Taylor murder case brought thrills, mystery and the glamour of big names, but to others it brought tragedy and sorrow," she said. There was a long pause. Perhaps the hectic days of the first Taylor case investigation were ringing through Mrs. Shelby's mind. Perhaps there came a train of thought that carried swiftly the amazing story of Mary's rise and the events that followed her famous director's unexplained murder. If Mrs. Shelby thought about the $1,000,000 suit filed by her daughter in 1926 and of her demand for accountings, for audits and for return of money earned in the films, she gave no indication of this. And if the drama of that intense recital of Mary's visit to the body of Taylor, recalled to her a few minutes before, took her back to memories tinged with the romance of her beautiful daughter, Mrs. Shelby managed to hide her emotions. Earlier in the interview some allusion was made to Mary Miles Minter's glowing account of the slain director and to the love letters and tokens, most of them unidentified, found in his apartment after the murder. "I'm sure, Mr. Taylor was a gentleman," Mrs. Shelby said. She hesitated a little, and then went on. "I'm going to rip all this innuendo wide open -- there is no other way," she went on. "I know that there have been reports that I was in love with Mr. Taylor and that I was jealous of my daughter and also feared that Mary's career would suffer, and that I killed Taylor to preserve my love and Mary's film future. "I am repeating these things just to show the absurdity of them. How is it possible to have such a double motive? The mere repetition of it shows the absurdity of the whole thing. Killing Mr. Taylor would have wrecked Mary's career instead of saving it. "But aside from that, the whole thing is ridiculous -- and vicious. "I am a woman who has always stood alone. "I was not in love with William Desmond Taylor. I was not in love with anyone. And no one was in love with me. I never held a purely social conversation with Mr. Taylor in my life. He was always aloof, a man of mystery, polished, distant and reserved. "In those days my tasks and interests were few. I lived, talked, planned and worked only for Mary and her pictures. "How utterly ridiculous, how unjust and criminal, to cast accusations of such flimsy nature, merely on 'clues' of such thin stuff. A crime without a motive, or reason." Mrs. Shelby's references to Taylor were most impersonal. In fact, she said during the interview, Taylor himself was impersonal. She came back to the night of February 1, 1922, when Taylor was shot and killed only a few minutes after the vivacious Mabel Normand, his dinner guest that night, left the bungalow of the man she, along with many others, admired. She talked of Sands -- Edward F. Sands, the butler-valet of the slain director who robbed and flaunted his employer because he knew of his checkered past. Of the incidents leading up to and following the actual slaying of "Bill" Taylor, Mrs. Shelby said but little. She refused to express an opinion. And of Henry Peavey, the colored house boy and cook, who served dinner on the night of the murder and left just before Miss Normand, Mrs. Shelby also had little to say. "I do not remember seeing him at the Taylor bungalow the night I called to see Mr. Taylor," was all she said. "But this point seems to be overlooked generally when these vicious whispers are passed about," Mrs. Shelby added. "The time of the murder was pretty well fixed. Mrs. Douglas MacLean, who heard the shot, saw a man leave the Taylor bungalow. Mrs. MacLean was in her own apartment, and from the front door, only a short distance away, saw this man and described him. "Do I answer that description?" Mrs. Shelby said smilingly as she rose to her feet and held out her silk-encased arms. "Dressed in men's clothes? But why" Why would a woman run the extra risk of being detected by wearing clothes in which she at once would become conspicuous? "This whole affair, however, is far from a jest to us. As I have said before, I have made complete statements and stand ready to make them if needed and if they can be of any use. "But I will not remain idle and be a target. From now on I am going to seek out those who circulate these rumors. "I am back in California, the land I love. I am not in seclusion, as has been printed, nor am I hiding from any one or anything. There are some things that I must reserve for the future. Some of them may hold the solution to the motive for the circulation of these cruel rumors." Mrs. Shelby rose to bid her interviewer good-by. "You may add," she said smilingly, "that I will remain right here and that if I do move from this charming apartment to our own home, I will not be in seclusion or in hiding."

Mabel's Reading Matter

February 18, 1922 FARGO FORUM Mabel Normand gave us the best laugh of the week. Did you note the dispatch telling of the fact that a copy of the POLICE GAZETTE was "on the seat of her limousine" while she and her chauffeur were at the curb in front of Mr. Taylor's house? The laugh comes when you consider that this country rewards, with chauffeurs and limousines, movie actresses whose literary tastes run to the POLICE GAZETTE. There is a good secondary laugh in Miss Normand's statement that she respected Mr. Taylor and liked "his views on philosophy." It seemed that he discussed Freud, Haeckel and Nietzsche with her. But that copy of The Police Gazette convinces us that Mr. Taylor did most of the discussing, while Mabel concealed her yawns as best she could. Freud and the POLICE GAZETTE! We'll say that Mabel is certainly catholic in her literary tastes. If you insist on getting excited about the situation, the thing to get excited about, to our way of thinking, is not the fact that Hollywood stages some "wild parties"--they can be found on every Main Street--but the fact that a chit of a girl with a pretty face and an intellect that aspires no higher than the POLICE GAZETTE can earn more in a year than we pay the President of the United States. Surely our standards of values are all wrong. Maybe we ought to pass a law about it, or have a congressional investigation, or something.

Salsinger DETROIT NEWS Magazines devoted to motion picture plays and players do a great deal of harm by the nauseating drivel that they print. The silly prattle that is put into the mouths of screen players who are "interviewed" for these magazines and then pen pictures drawn of them are beyond reason. Rex Ingram, a scholar, is not given any better "boost" than a former salesgirl who has suddenly become a headliner. The same superlatives that are used to discuss Ingram are used to describe the brainless cutie whose face is her fortune and whose brain is still in the kindergarten age. It is a long jump from paperbound novels and chewing gum to Plato and Thoreau, but the facile writer of the screen monthlies blithely makes this leap. It must have been with pain and anguish that the screen fans read how Mabel Normand, pictured as a devotee of Voltaire and Nietzsche, testified that on her way to William Taylor's house on the fatal night she stopped at a newstand to buy a bag of peanuts and a copy of the POLICE GAZETTE.

There is a young lady who reads 'em high and reads 'em low. We read in the public prints that she graciously allowed a reporter to interview her about the visit she made to that movie gentleman out in Hollywood and told the young lad that she had gone there for some reading matter to take home with her, the same being a treatise by a gentleman named Nietzsche who writes long paragraphs full of long words and hard to pronounce. About philosophy, and all such like. Then we are assured by Mabel's chauffeur that another treatise which she had obtained on her visit was a copy of the POLICE GAZETTE. And instantly, and at once, and even sooner we say to ourselves that Mabel is there when it comes to literature. She doesn't cultivate one portion of her brain cells at the expense of the others. She is not going to be the possessor of a single track mind. That her mind shall not be a Jack Spratt and his wife sort of mind, but rather a combination of the Spratt variety wherein both fat and lean shall be furnished. When her eyelids droop over the "will to conquer" sort of highbrowism that Nietzsche deals out she can lightly turn to the POLICE GAZETTE and there fill up on beauty unadorned on the outside cover and learn how Kilrain nearly licked old John L., down on the hot sands of the Gulf of Mexico in the long ago. [10] And view the picture and get the name and address of the most popular barber in Lilliwaup Falls, Wash. Or it may even be that she may send a postal to Box, number something somewhere or other, and beg back word where to send five dollars for a deck of marked cards. Between old Mister Nietzsche and the POLICE GAZETTE it's no wonder that Mabel is nervous and confined to her bed.

***************************************************************************** The Funeral

February 8, 1922 KANSAS CITY TIMES (Los Angeles. Feb. 7.)--Laughter and screams and prayers marked the funeral here today of William Desmond Taylor, murdered motion picture director. With two thousand notables of the screen world and their friends seated within St. Paul's Episcopal Pro-Cathedral, a crowd of thirty thousand without fought for admittance. Failing to gain entrance the vast majority of those left on the outside hemmed the streets and overflowed Pershing square. The police were powerless. And while the Rev. William McCormick, dean of St. Paul's was reading the service and speaking the prayers for the dead prince of Shadowland, shouts and laughter from the jostling, hysterical, riotous throng echoed through the Pro-Cathedral. "Five a bag, they're hot," yelled peanut vendors. Lemonade stands, hastily constructed, were doing a thriving business. As the pallbearers, all men mighty in the film world, carried the casket up the aisle and the great organ began the impressive Handel's "Largo," by some curious irony of fate the strains were mingled with those of a jazz band playing in the Philharmonic auditorium a few hundred feet away.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 BOSTON GLOBE In California a moving picture producer was murdered under circumstances of mystery. His funeral was held in a church. Inside were gathered a party of famous moving picture actors and actresses, and a throng which packed the church to its doors. Outside, in the street, was a crowd of 30,000 people, which the police were powerless to manage. They fought to get into the church, and the reading of the funeral service by the dean of the cathedral was to an accompaniment of the cries of the women caught in the crowd-pack outside. One of the actresses [11] fainted at the end of the funeral, but the crowd was too dense to allow her to be removed from the church. The negro valet of the deceased had a fit of hysterics. There was evidently some misunderstanding about this funeral. It seems to have been mistaken for a moving picture scenario. Such a mistake was perhaps natural, what with the stars, the mob, and the emotional scenes. Yet, however much like a scenario this funeral may have seemed, it was not a scenario--it was a real funeral. And in this fact lies its importance. Try to construct a world conducted according to the principles which seem to govern life in a moving picture scenario, and what would you have? Well, it might be something like society in the moving picture town of Hollywood, Calif,; but it would hardly be like any other place under the moon, unless it were two or three of the livelier circles of Inferno as described by Dante. A world where love-making is the leading industry. Where the souls of gentleman crooks are saved by a species of sex evangelism. Where the poor girl invariably marries the millionaire and experiences no discomforts from the sudden change in her social status. Where every second policeman is a crook; and all rich men's sons are idle and vicious; and every mother-in-law is a she-dragon; and waiters throw pies at complaining diners; where, if a stranger looks squint-eyed at your girl, the correct thing is to paste him one in the eye; and where, if your sentimental affairs get into a snarl, you take poison or else shoot the gentleman who has incurred your displeasure. Try living in such a world--even, if it be only a world of the imagination--for a while, and see the frame of mind you fall into. Is it so strange that the gentleman whose funeral was turned into a movie mob scene should have met such an end? Suppose, innocently or otherwise, he had given offense to an emotional person living in such an hysterical world: what more natural than to translate the scenario into reality, as was done at the funeral itself? The fact is that few worlds have more influence over our conduct than this world of imagination. It is there that we make or unmake ourselves. With our imaginations under the spell of such a fantastic world as that in the scenarios of filmdom, is it any wonder that so many of the daily events which startle and shame us should seem, like this funeral, to have been translated out of that world of riotous imagination into a world of more or less riotous reality?

***************************************************************************** The Investigation

February 4, 1922 LONDON TIMES (Los Angeles)--What the police regard as an important clue was discovered this afternoon. Detectives are investigating a "dope party" given at Hollywood recently, at which cocaine and other drugs were served instead of drinks. Two women, both film actresses, stated that they quarreled over Taylor and fought, ripping the clothes from each other's bodies. Taylor was not present at the party. The police theory is that Taylor's murder was contrived by one of the women, to whose advances he had refused to respond.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 6, 1922 LONG BEACH PRESS "Comb the dope dens of Hollywood!" This terse order was issued today by Detective Captain David L. Adams, following a conference at police headquarters of all agencies working on the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery. It was understood that a new clue had been received connecting the supposed slayer of the famed motion picture director with the operations of a well-organized Hollywood "snowball" ring.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 14, 1922 CLEVELAND PRESS (Los Angeles)--"The queen of the drug fiends" was hunted today in the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery. This woman, head of a powerful drug ring operating in Hollywood, knows the circumstances of Taylor's killing, in the belief of county officials. Efforts to locate the "drug queen" have brought about a thorough search of Chinatown where the "hop" was prepared for the orgies in which its customers indulged. Habitual hangouts of drug addicts were deserted today and all known members of the ring, including its queen, have gone into hiding. Her last place of residence has been searched. A number of interesting names are understood to have been found on her books. The "queen" is described as a woman of beauty who does not show the ravages of the drugs she distributed to the ring's victims. Tracing the woman's movements during the last few months, officers have found she frequently changed her place of residence but that she always lived near Taylor's home.

O'Neill, the detectives said, had a "deck" of heroin with him which he had just purchased. "I've been in the movies three years," O'Neill told Massam, "and out there at Hollywood the dope got me for fair. We used to go out on the lots and shoot ourselves full of dope. It was the regular thing. "I could get the stuff easy, and the stars and dames used to come to me and beg for it. Many a swell star I've handed a deck of dope to. I knew Taylor, the director, very well, but never worked under him. I left Hollywood the day before he was killed and came East. "I've been getting morph right up to now, but today I fell down and had to make a break for the heroin. The dope has got me for fair, just like it's got a lot of the rest of us that played in the lots out Hollywood way." O'Neill was locked up and will be examined again today by Special Deputy Commissioner Dr. Carleton Simon, in charge of the Narcotic Squad, who questioned him last night about his methods of getting dope both here and in California.

He told of driving Miss Normand to the apartment court in South Alvarado street, of reaching there about 7:15, of seeing Miss Normand disappear into the court in the direction of Taylor's home, of her reappearance with Taylor after about half an hour, of her chatting with Taylor for a moment at the curb and of the actress's waving good-by as the car moved off. He also told how Henry Peavey, Taylor's butler, left the house while Miss Normand was still there, and of stopping to pass a word with him beside the automobile. This conversation, Davis said today, was brief, for as he comes from the South, he explained, it is not his habit to exchange idle gossip with Southerners of darker hue.

One reason cited for the lack of an arrest was that "You've got to be sure of your ground when you jail a movie celebrity." There is an ever growing tendency among those close to the case to marvel at the histrionics displayed by some of those questioned. One investigator today explained the lack of progress by proclaiming almost admiringly and with no little awe, "They lie so beautifully."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 24, 1922 SAVANNAH NEWS Great progress is reported in the untangling of the Taylor murder case. It has been rather definitely determined that in all probability there seems to be enough evidence, of a circumstantial if not substantial kind, to believe with some show of moral certainty that there was somewhere, either before or after or during the time of the crime, a woman, in some way, directly or indirectly, mixed up with some of the elements connected with the life of the man who was killed. Probably, more startling still, more than one woman!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 7, 1922 DES MOINES REGISTER A dainty pink silk nightgown, bearing three initials of a motion picture star of the first magnitude, is held at police headquarters as the latest clue in the William Desmond Taylor murder case. The gown had been in possession of a police detective who has been quietly working along lines of his own. The little star to whom the garment is said to belong is not a comedienne. She has gained much publicity during the last year because of numerous wealthy and prominent young men who have been seen in her company and to whom she was variously reported as engaged. Hollywood was shocked by the disclosure. The name of the star involved was on every tongue. Taylor's closest friends professed amazement. They were utterly confused, they said, by the discovery and by the facts now coming to light which indicate the complexity of the dead man's past.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 4, 1922 MOVING PICTURE WORLD (reprinted from OTTAWA JOURNAL) It is probable that a fair percentage of those who are most closely following the Los Angeles murder case are more anxious to learn the identity of the owner of the nightdress found in the dead man's apartment than that of the murderer.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 10, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES The belief of detectives that if Edward F. Sands, valet-secretary to William D. Taylor, killed his employer, he was insane, was bolstered last night by information tending to show that the missing fugitive was mentally deranged. "I don't know what I'd do if I lost my job and didn't have any money," Sands is reported to have said. "When I get to be 35 years old I'm going to blow my head off. I don't see any use of people living after that age. They're not good for anything." Sands always carried a .45-caliber Colt revolver, Mr. Brettner said. One morning Mr. Brettner went to Sands's room and found him asleep. He touched him on the shoulder to awaken him. Sands turned over like a flash and pressed the weapon against Mr. Brettner, but when he saw who it was he turned over and went to sleep again without saying a word.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 ST. LOUIS STAR A handkerchief, initialed "S," picked up near the body of Movie Director Taylor, is held as evidence against his former valet, Sands. Without decrying the general case against Sands, we submit that this handkerchief is evidence in his favor. What man ever succeeded in getting or keeping a handkerchief with his own initial on it? The editor of the Star has a dozen or more initialed sneeze-cloths, with letters at intervals from A to W, and not one in the lot could be used as evidence against him if he yielded to his occasional inclination to commit murder.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 14, 1922 LOS ANGELES RECORD This startling story laid before District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine by a bootlegger was under investigation Tuesday: "I was delivering liquor in half-pint bottles at the Taylor bungalow. I was carrying it in two cases used to pack automobile tire inner cases. I approached the front door from the side of the house. As I reached the shrubbery at the front of the house I heard the shot. "I stood for three or four seconds--maybe 10--and I saw a woman leave the Taylor bungalow. She hurried away. "I said to myself: 'This is no place for me,' and I hurried back to my car. I threw the cases into the automobile with such force that I broke a half dozen of the bottles. " 'Let's go' I told my chauffeur and we beat it east down the street."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 12, 1922 CHICAGO TRIBUNE (Los Angeles)--A group of investigators tonight went to dig up the cellar in the Taylor home. They had been told by an anonymous informant that something of great value was hidden in the cellar; something not money, but which would show a connection between certain persons and the slaying. They went out armed with picks and shovels and spades, only to find there was no cellar.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 14, 1922 ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH (Los Angeles)--No official connected with the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery is willing today to declare that any actual progress had been made toward its solution. The officers are at work and still express determination to do their best to find the slayer of the film director, but found themselves confronted with "too many wild tips," they say, and too few genuine clues. Many of these "tips" live through one edition of a newspaper-
-and disappear. The detectives of the Police Department still declare their belief that the case never will be cleared up until Edward F. Sands, the missing former butler-secretary to Taylor, has been discovered. And the Sheriff's deputies are still firm in their contention that Sands had nothing to do with the case. The air is filled with rumors of "mystery men," "mystery women," "mystery witnesses," "drug peddlers," "jealousy motives" and "revenge theories," but back of them all the fact that Sands had not been found: that the murderer has not been arrested, and that the case is still unsolved. The investigation has reached a stage which is described by officials directing the inquiry as of "waiting for the unexpected."

He called on Captain Adams to let him know of his intentions. "Not so," said Adams. "You will stay in Los Angeles until released." "I can't stay, captain," said the negro. "I'se very lonesome without Mr. Taylor. I'll sure miss him, captain. Got no one now to squz oranges or lemings for. Got no nice room to do my sewing in. Please let me go." The captain explained that he wanted Peavey to remain as a material witness, and declared that if he tried to go away he might find himself in another nice sewing room, with free board.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 17, 1922 CHICAGO AMERICAN (Chicago)--Lou Mary Snyder is a seamstress, ladies' and men's tailor, and can make anything from a handkerchief to a suit of clothes. She was busily stitching away today in her home at 1334 N. Dearborn St. when the telephone rang. "This is the state's attorney," said a voice. "We would like to interview you concerning the Taylor case--" "Yes, I'm a tailor," cut in Miss Snyder. "If it suits you come down to see us at once," the voice continued. "It is in accordance with the request of Mr. Woolwine in Los Angeles." Miss Snyder hurried to the state's attorney's office. She laid out her cloth, got her tape measure and started to fit the state's attorney in a suit. But they insisted on questioning her concerning the murder of William D. Taylor. "Why, I thought you wanted a tailor to make a suit out of wine-colored wool," said the surprised seamstress. She was dismissed as the possible Margaret Snyder the state's attorney's office is seeking. The detectives renewed their search and found the woman Mr. Woolwine was seeking at Rockford, Ill.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 22, 1922 PASADENA STAR-NEWS District Attorney Woolwine's office was in the midst of a probe into the Taylor murder mystery. The telephone ball jangled. W. C. Doran answered. "I gotta hunch on this here murder case!" the mysterious informant told him. "They've got a serum [12] down in Dallas, Texas, that makes people tell the truth. Give 'em a shot in the arm, and veracity spouts like a gusher. Why not give some of those dumb witnesses of yours a dose of that?" Mr. Doran, after some moments of concentrated effort to grasp the idea, burst into laughter. Whereupon the amateur scientist on the other end of the wire, highly indignant, slammed down the receiver.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 15, 1922 Wallace Smith CHICAGO AMERICAN (Los Angeles)--It is now believed that the slayer, before he left Taylor's study, straightened up the room and "laid out" Taylor's body. It was even suggested that a woman may have helped. "She may have been very fond of him," remarked one of the detectives, with a serious face, "and so tried to leave his body as neat as possible. Also the room. You know how women are."

February 14, 1922 CLEVELAND PRESS The Los Angeles police have the Taylor murderer in a net. They are tightening the net. They are not certain of the man's name. They do not know what he looks like.

Since then the police authorities have given the most exemplary imitation of polite and tender dealing yet recorded in the annals of crime. The only judgment one can form is that the police are afraid to discover the responsibility for the murderer.

Just as Dr. Doyle's fiction detective used to anathematize the bunglers who destroyed foot-prints, removed clues or allowed priceless indications to pass unobserved, just so, we imagine, the officers concerned in the Desmond Taylor case must feel toward a few score of amateurs, reporters and "nuts" who have messed up the hot trail of the killer. If the murderer of Taylor is ever apprehended, it will be because some skilled and experienced officer, discarding all vague, wild, fantastic and fabricated theories, starts at the ghastly beginning and works forward soberly and carefully toward the end. And in doing that it is almost certain that he will be immensely hampered by the mess of the bunglers who have gone before. It has been stated that clever criminals keep out of the way of the police by reading the newspapers. Certainly if some officers tell as much about their plans as some newspapers would have us believe they must warn their quarry a long time in advance.

It seems as if every one who knew Taylor or could in any fashion be connected with the case has been interrogated at least a half dozen times. The police and the fame-seeking District Attorney of the California metropolis apparently have questioned persons who had no more to do with Taylor's murder than the residents of the Canary Islands. One Woolwine, District Attorney, made what he called an independent investigation, with a camera-man tagging him around and reporters in his following. Woolwine posed in the Taylor house with an assistant taking the part of the picture director--this being done to "reconstruct the crime." How would that help find the criminal? In their efforts the police and the Woolwine force have sent several reputable actresses into retirement, suffering from nervous prostration, and have cast some slight suspicion on a few persons who could not possibly kill another. The time has come for these Los Angeles sleuths and Woolwine and his actors to get off the job, and devote their time to whatever business may be at hand. Skilled detectives should take over the case and follow it to the end. Motion picture makers of Hollywood have raised a fund to hunt down Taylor's slayer, and they can put it to good use by dealing with a reputable detective agency and ignoring the incompetents of the police force and the District Attorney of Los Angeles.
