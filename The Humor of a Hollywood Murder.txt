"The Humor of a Hollywood Murder" by Bruce Long

(This was originally intended to be a book published in hardcopy form, but efforts to find a publisher were unsuccessful. So it will be serialized within this newsletter.)

Foreword by Kevin Brownlow

No amount of money would have induced me to write an introduction to a book about the "humour" of the Taylor case. But Bruce Long tempted me with copies of exceptionally rare 1913 issues of Photoplay, and as the saying went in Hollywood in those days, the only way to cope with temptation is to give in to it. Few of Taylor's films survive, but I was very impressed with his 1920 production of "Soul of Youth," about juvenile delinquency, made with an almost Dikensian feel for the squalor and brutality of reform schools. But my interest in Taylor lies beyond his work. My friend Liam O'Leary once took a picture of the house in Cappoquin, Co Waterford where Taylor grew up. I showed it to my wife, Virginia, and she had to sit down. It was the same house in which she had grown up. His family, the Deane-Tanners, were Anglo-Irish landowners; it is perfectly accurate to call him "British" but it would be closer to the truth to call him Anglo-Irish. They were a special breed, dying out now, but worthy of a few volumes of their own. (My wife's brother, Molly Keane, has done sterling work in this regard, but she recalls the Deane-Tanners only vaguely from her youth, and feels there are dark deeds associated with them.) The Irish are the most humorous people imaginable, and had Taylor survived the shooting, he might have cracked some jokes about it. Somehow, the idea of the press finding humour in the event causes one less amusement than indignation. America's yellow press, particularly the tabloids owned by Hearst, were far worse than anything represented by Hollywood. How they got away with their repellent stories, gory photographs and sanctimonious hypocrisy, while women's clubs got steamed up about the charming love-making of silent films, is beyond me. On the other hand, this is the press of The Front Page era; you can imagine the tough reporters, their hats tilted back on their head, swigging their prohibition gin from hip flasks, their prose flushing as purple as their noses. This book is a fascinating comment on American society.

Introduction by Bruce Long

On the surface there was nothing whatsoever amusing about the unsolved cold-blooded murder of top Hollywood film director William Desmond Taylor on February 1, 1922. The single gunshot which punctured his left lung not only ended Taylor's life but also helped ruin the careers of two top female stars and fueled unprecedented public outcry against Hollywood. Most of the nation was not amused; Hollywood certainly was not. But as days passed and the many bizarre threads of the case came to light, more and more humorous commentary began to appear in the press. The Taylor case has been written about many times and has inspired three full-length books, but authors have generally ignored the humor inspired by the case. This series is a collection of that original humorous press material. The Hollywood film industry has come under verbal public attack at various times throughout its existence, but those attacks were never greater than in the month following Taylor's murder. The revelations accompanying the Taylor case prompted the disclosure of other sensational allegations against Hollywood, and national anti-Hollywood sentiment peaked at this time. Subsequently, Will Hays assumed control of the movie industry and was able to placate much of the anti-Hollywood sentiment. With the passage of time, public morality changed and people were no longer so outraged by the activities of the film colony. The humorous aspects of that anti-Hollywood sentiment falls within the scope of this series. A substantial part of this series contains "unintentional humor" which was intended to be taken very seriously, but which nevertheless may seem to be amusing from our current perspective. Some of the material has been edited, and some material has been arbitrarily assigned to one chapter instead of another because there is some overlapping of subject matter. A few stereotyped comments which are offensive today but were relatively commonplace in 1922 have been included for historical purposes. It should be kept in mind that the material presented in this series has been selected for humor, not for veracity. Incidents and characterizations should not be blindly accepted as fact. This volume contains very little factual information about the Taylor case, but a great deal of information about the social and cultural attitudes of the press, the public and Hollywood in the aftermath of Taylor's murder. It is hoped that this series, while presenting a substantial collection of source material useful to scholars, will also be entertaining and humorous by today's standards.

Prologue February 15, 1922 Alvaro Shoemaker SEATTLE UNION-RECORD We ought to be glad this thing happened down in Los Angeles--that is, glad that it happened in Los Angeles instead of Seattle. It was a "big" murder, as the news boys put it, and--like all big things--we need the distance to give us a proper perspective. We were just about to despair of the movies giving us any thrills other than those in the films themselves. Fatty Arbuckle gave us a good show--while it lasted. [51] But he has gone through his second trial, and it drew so poorly that District Attorney Brady threatens positively to withdraw it after one more performance. Things were slowing up badly. California was having a rotten winter. Tourists were leaving. And then-- Action! Action! William Desmond Taylor, world's greatest movie director, British army captain, art connoisseur, traveler, dilettante, divorcee, bon vivant, occultist, et cetera, et cetera, as well as sole proprietor of the finest, best appointed, most frequently visited and most generously occupied love nest in the city of Los Angeles--William Desmond Taylor, Love Avalanche of Alvarado, [52] is found dead! Once again Los Angeles triumphed over her ancient, jealous sister. San Francisco could claim the Arbuckle affair. It was small, sordid; did not offer the element of mystery; just a plain drunk, with a killing for a chaser. Bah! In Los Angeles a real he-man bit the dust--a sure-enough lady killer, with more handkerchiefs, gloves, powder puffs and pale-and-thin lingerie in his trophy list than an Arbuckle could ever hope to bag with all the seeming advantage of superior booze and top weight. And compare the women in the case. Fatty's list of "those present" might be the register of the Home for Dessicated, Debilitated and Flatfooted Hashers. Who remembers them? Fatty had to bait with booze for his moths in order to get them to circulate around the formless, only partly combustible hunk of tallow that was Arbuckle, in the hope that one at least might get drunk enough to fall in. Now look--if your eyes be not too dazzled--look, look at the lambent flame of Desmond Taylor. Mark that classy galaxy that moves in queenly strides around the central orb. Think you they are drawn and held by sordid things? Not so. S'love, s'love! The Arbuckle setting was one of corks, empties, cigarette butts and katzenjammers. [53] Taylor died surrounded by incense, code love notes, monogramed hankies and pink teddy-bears. [54] The sauce piquante of the Taylor affair would be a fetching dressing to pour over even the classiest of chicken served up on the silver screen.

Wild Hollywood Parties: Fact or Fiction?

March 12, 1922 CHATTANOOGA TIMES (Chattanooga)--Declaring that he had recently been in Hollywood and other points in Southern California, and was thus informed of conditions there, evangelist John Brown told his congregation of women that what little they may have read of the degradation and vice existing in the motion picture colonies had but touched at the edges of things as they are. One hundred of the leading actresses have organized as the "Nude 100," he said, and the fetes of the organization could not have been surpassed in wicked Sodom and Gomorrah of old.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 13, 1922 Lindsay Denison NEW YORK EVENING WORLD (Los Angeles)--There was a "party" which was raided by the police though nothing came of the raid. After a commonplace entertainment remarkable only for stupid vulgarity, "refreshments were served." But the servants had not food and drink on their trays--they had hypodermic needles, papers of "snow" and opium layouts. There was a "pill cooking contest" between noted headliners. It was at this point that the police broke in. The host broke out at the same moment and a few minutes later appeared at his front door in his palatial car, demanding to know "what had been going on his absence."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 Edward Doherty NEW YORK NEWS (Los Angeles)--William Desmond Taylor would have been a Patrician had he lived in Rome when it was at its greatest and wickedest. Taylor's ghost might boast to the other ghosts of having been at better parties than any that they had seen. He might tell them, for instance, that little tale told by an humble Jap. [5] The Jap served as valet to half a dozen stars; was butler at a number of houses. Let him, for the story's sake, relate his tale in English. It was the Jap's first time in the mansion--the home of one of the most beautiful and famous actresses in the world. "They asked me serve the dinner for them last night. I was delighted when they asked me. I said to myself, 'I will really see this angel-like creature, this woman that has filled my life with beauty.' I was exhalted. I tread reverently in that house. "The guests came, two by two, man and wife, in great automobiles. They came in laughing, full of happiness. I had seen them all. The greatest stars in the world! "A dozen of them there were. And how I admired them! "One of them sang while the dinner was getting ready; one of them played the piano. Then one of them danced. I peeked through the door, which I held open just a little--so. The dinner was ready. The guests sat down at the table. Such silverware! Such wonderful linen! Such great heaps of food! Lamps were burning everywhere, and there were many flowers. "I served the cocktails. I brought on the courses. I brought on wine and highballs, and green drinks, and yellow, and orange, and purple drinks. "I was bringing in the coffee service on a cart when the big man threw a plate of food at me. He hit me with it. He hit me in the face. The gravies trickled down my vest and on to the rug--the rug worth thousands of dollars. "They thought it fun. They shouted. Men commenced to throw things at the women. The women threw things at the men. "Soon the food was flying all over the room. Costly china plates were smashed against the walls. Statues were thrown down and broken, pictures were ruined. Flowers were strewn everywhere, mashed under heels. "They got up, drunk, most of them. They threw whisky and wine at each other. One man poured a bottle of champagne down the front of a sweet little girl's neck and the language she used! Never have I heard such words! "The victrola was turned on; the big man yanked the tablecloth from the table and put it on him and gave a war whoop like the Indians, and danced around, making gestures that were nasty. "Everybody followed him. They yelled. They whooped. They threw chairs at mirrors. One man, very graceful he was, turned cartwheels, and his feet struck a woman and knocked her down. She put her arms around him and kissed him and bathed his hair with half a tumbler full of whisky. "Then the big man jumped on the table and pulled open his shirt and exposed his stomach. He held his stomach with his big left hand, and with the other he plunged a hypodermic needle into it. [6] It sickened me, but everybody laughed. " 'This is the life!' he shouted, and jumped down and took a lady in his arms and went into another room. She was not the lady he came in with. Everybody left the room too, with everybody else's wife, except the lady that owned the house; and she laughed, and told me to get busy and clean up the place." Perhaps the ghost of the murdered Taylor may come back to the scene of these old revels and visit with the blades that still hold orgies in the palaces of Hollywood.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 13, 1922 Lindsay Denison NEW YORK EVENING WORLD It was under such influences as the unlimited supply of intoxicants and narcotics that a "distinguished gathering" (speaking filmily) at the mansion in a village near Hollywood became a "menagerie party." The guests got down on all fours and proceeded to conduct themselves each as he conceived the animal he was imitating would act in his native jungle or sty. As the festivities became "jazzed up" the terrific noises and the squeals and screams of some of the women, who didn't like the playful tricks of the human wild beasts, caused quieter members of the community to violate their usual reticence and call the police. The Chief of Police undertook the errand himself. The noise died down for a time; about daylight it became so outrageous again that a committee of scandalized outsiders gathered at the front door. They were just in time to meet the Chief of Police coming out, hatless, with his hair tousled, blood running from a torn ear and with an "extra" girl hanging unconscious in his arms. He declared he was "the original Borneo organ-outang returning to the jungle with the fairest of the villagers." The sight of the horrified neighbors sobered him into releasing the fair villager, but he isn't Chief of Police in that suburb any more.

We have been led to believe that all those lads and girls cavorting before the movie camera in Hollywood and vicinity are daily guilty of more rascality than all the deviltries ever charged against John Doe and his degenerate relative, Richard Roe, put together.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 3, 1922 TACOMA LEDGER If all those stories told of the Los Angeles movie colony are true, why do the sensational film producers go to all the trouble of scenarios and posed pictures? Why not just turn their cameras on Hollywood from day to day?
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 Edward Doherty NEW YORK NEWS (Los Angeles)--The "love cult" angle was introduced into the case late in the day through the troubled conscience of a resident of Chinatown. This man through an intermediary communicated with the District Attorney's office and asked that he be given immunity in exchange for information in his possession. He had supplied the opium for the members of this cult, all men, of which, he says, Taylor was a member. He declares the men would lie in silk kimonos, smoke the essence of the poppy flower and so commence their ritual, old as Sodom. The Chinese asserted that the members of the cult were held together by a bond, unthinkable, unnameable, unbelievable, and that each had sworn an oath of undying affection for the others. He believes the jealousy of one of these degenerate cultists may have caused him to slay the movie man.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 22, 1922 Herb Westen SAN FRANCISCO CALL-POST (Los Angeles)--There seems to be a concerted move to muffle the reports of Hollywood vice. The Chamber of Commerce has taken it up and a petition, it is understood, is now being circulated to prevail upon a Chicago newspaperman to "go away from here." Local interests charge that he has painted the colony too black--that his imagination has run away with his judgement.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 25, 1922 Rob Wagner OAKLAND TRIBUNE Eastern newspapers now are painting pictures of a "movie colony" that surpass anything our wildest directors ever put on the screen to show decadence and crime. This modern Gomorrah is known the world over as Hollywood, and, according to population imagination, its streets are lined with dance-halls, cabarets, magnificent gambling joints and opium dens, the denizens of the film colony working but one or two temperamental hours a day, devoting the other twenty-three to delicious sin. Movie queens, in inlaid limousines, roll through the golden avenues to meet wicked directors intent upon their happy ruin, bathing parties nightly plunge into tanks of eau-de-cologne, while beautiful "snow birds" attend cocaine parties at which the Japanese servants administer drugs from silver needles; while every morning the police, seizing the blonde curls of your beautiful film favorite, drag her from some subterranean hop-joint. [7] One eastern paper goes so far as to say that "the needle-hounds of Hollywood order their drugs over the telephone like groceries." [8] No, puzzled reader, these tales of "love cults" and "dope rings" are just good old newspaper hokum. The only real evidence I can offer in the use of narcotics is the hectic nonsense emanating from the drugged sconces of the newspaper fellows, who have been looking at Hollywood through dope rings of their own blowing.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 25, 1922 Baxter MOVING PICTURE WORLD In Hollywood the poppies blow, Tall columns rise of poppy smoke. The correspondents snuff the "snow," Then write in dreams that come from "coke." The hop pipes glow, the stories grow-- Old heroin provides the facts-- Imaginations slumming go, And twist the simple, kindly acts. The hemp, the hashish and the dope Arrange that blameless folk bear blame. Fake interviews with shadow ghosts Are easy when you use no name. The orgies that they write about Are brain creations of their own. The lethal fumes arising high Come in rings that they have blown. It matters not how wild the lie. If readable "It's fit to print." The buzzards to their carrion fly And gorge their public without stint. In Hollywood the poppies blow, They will continue so to do Until the voice of Truth prevails And tells the liars they are through.

Writer Answers Screen Defense of Soiled Nest

"How can there be men and women writers anywhere on earth base enough to invent any or all of the lurid stories that have been printed so generally about Hollywood and the film people?" The question was asked in an article by Frank Woods, president of the Screen Writers' Guild of the Authors' League of America, and Thompson Buchanan, chairman of the Writers Club, which was printed in the CHICAGO TRIBUNE of March 1 and in other papers throughout the country. The article, a defense of Hollywood and the film people, is in reality an attack upon Wallace Smith of the CHICAGO EVENING AMERICAN and myself--and Mr. Woods and Mr. Buchanan mentioned our names, branding us as liars, fakers, slanderers, dealers in scandal. Mr. Smith and I have been warned repeatedly that gangs of men employed in the studios have sworn to "get us." [9] We have been called "space writers," representatives of the "scurrilous eastern press," and it has been intimated that we are users of drugs ourselves--we who complain that a few movie actors ease their worries with a sniff or a shot in the arm. But the movie people who have threatened violence have taken the more prudent method. They have not come near us. They have left the matter to their writing men-- and these have attacked us in the newspapers. I should not have replied to these articles had the TRIBUNE, for which I write, not printed the Woods-Buchanan article. The TRIBUNE printed it because the TRIBUNE believes in fair play. Had there not been a reference to Mr. Smith and myself I should not have challenged a single statement of these two Hollywood writers. In the first place let me explain that neither Wallace Smith nor Edward Doherty is a space writer. [10] Both of us, writing space, could have made thousands of dollars; neither of us made a cent. We wrote what we pleased, spending extra hours to send it, merely because we were assigned to the story and felt it our duty to tell the world about Hollywood. Not a line of what we wrote was faked. Not a story was invented; not one article that either of us wrote contained a single thing that was untrue. [11] Both of us know that if we did print anything untrue there would be libel suits. There have been many articles in which we were referred to as liars and slanderers--but no libel suit has been started; and we do not believe one will be started. I live in Hollywood. I have lived there since last October. I have a year's lease on a house. I intend to go on living in Hollywood. I know Hollywood, and I know my neighbors. Wallace Smith has lived in the Ambassador Hotel since last November, but he knows Hollywood, too. He has frequently visited it in the company of actors and actresses. He has been to some of the Hollywood parties which-- according to Messrs. Woods and Buchanan--never occurred. It may be an interesting sidelight to record the fact that I, a conscienceless liar, a slanderous scandal monger, a reporter who has told so many untruths about Hollywood, should be offered the opportunity of becoming the chief publicity man for "Fatty" Roscoe Arbuckle--and that I should reject the offer as soon as it was made. I covered the Arbuckle story on three occasions in San Francisco. I had excellent opportunities for "faking," as the Woods-Buchanan combination calls it. But it appears I sadly neglected it--and the offer to become Arbuckle's publicity man came from one of Arbuckle's attorneys, a man who has read everything I have written, including my articles on Hollywood. "Hollywood is angry," said this lawyer. "The truth stings." I feel rather proud of this. The Woods-Buchanan article intimates that I sided with the district attorney against Arbuckle. I sided with nobody. I never do. I tell the facts as accurately as I can get them. I feel with the Screen Writers in this--that Arbuckle is innocent of the death of Virginia Rappe. "Arbuckle's mode of living," they said, "which was too often the same as that of thousands of young men of other stations in life, who, like him, have too much money, was nevertheless indefensible, and, somehow, someway, the impression was conveyed that he was a fair example of the film folks' depravity." That's what the Screen Writers said. I wouldn't have said that. Strange to say, I believe Arbuckle one of the cleanest of all moving picture actors. I didn't think so--but the conviction was drilled into me through watching him in his three ordeals and to listening to the evidence against him. "This quiet and beautiful section of Los Angeles has been treated to a drenching of slander unequaled in American journalism," the defenders say, "while film people themselves have been pictured largely as drug addicts, drunkards, profligates, and degenerates. If a half or a quarter or even a tenth of this muckraking is founded on fact then the people engaged in making motion pictures, particularly the stars, are of the wrong class and ought to be eliminated." True, and the "muckraking" is founded on a talk with a member of the state board of pharmacy, who has control of the drug addicts of Los Angeles and who has registered not a few moving picture stars and lesser lights with deputy sheriffs; with decent men and women picture players; with the local reporters, who wish they could print what they know; with the records in the police blotters. Neither Smith nor I was born yesterday. We have been in many cities in the United States and Mexico. Both of us have become more or less accustomed to looking on the seamy side of life--and both of us were amazed at the conditions that exist in the land of the movies. We were incredulous at first. We investigated. We found out the truth. And at the earliest opportunity, without consulting each other, we began to tell it. I regret to say that we were not the first to tell of what is going on in Hollywood--I do not say was going on, but is going on. Theodore Dreiser told some plain, blunt, ugly facts about directors and extra girls and other incidents in SHADOWLAND, a moving picture magazine. [12] I have not heard that either Mr. Woods or Mr. Buchanan called Mr. Dreiser a liar or a faker or a muckraker or even a space writer. Let's sum up the rest of the article briefly: "Work in pictures is exacting and mentally and physically exhausting--so much so that a great majority of the active workers have no time, strength, nor inclination for the revelries and orgies which have been pictured as the rule rather than the exception." But there is a minority that does find the time. We did not say the majority was rotten. We do say the minority is. "The camera is relentless, and no actor or actress, especially the younger ones whose faces are literally their fortunes, can remain long in the spotlight and at the same time give way to any sort of self-indulgence." Correct. There are a lot of favorites, still young, still beautiful, who no longer dare the camera's scrutiny. There are others who will be "removed" very soon. It is understood that Adolph Zukor came to the coast recently to get rid of one of the most prominent male stars in the world--who has been using a hypodermic needle. [13] "Taylor, himself, who had been a man of exemplary habits, fine deportment, and high ideals, turned out to have had an adventurous past. He had taken a stage name, like many others of theatrical profession, and this was made much of." He had a woman's nightgown in his home. He was attended by persons of no character. He was an intimate of several women, had deserted his wife and child. He took a couple of stage names. There are other accusations against him. One could go on indefinitely. The article complains that reporters said certain movie people questioned by the officials were "grilled." Smith and Doherty said they were not grilled, but should have been--and we repeat it. After telling how Smith and Doherty "seized on the Taylor mystery as an excuse for digging up and rehashing all the dead scandals of the picture people that had accumulated in the last ten years" the article admits "there were only a bare half dozen of them," adding, "but they were embellished, added to, and enlarged until they read like juicy stuff." Here's confirmation right out of the screen people themselves. We not only dug up a lot of dead scandals which were news because they had not been printed before--but we also told a lot of new ones. A writer in New York [14] tells how the film folk there recognized the persons talked about, even though in the first place the stories were untrue, and the characters, thinly disguised. This writer, after denying everything we wrote, added very naively, that we must have paid "some one on the inside" very well for our information. Then there is reference to an "alleged interview with a Jap butler--pure fiction." It was I who told the Jap butler's story. I don't know whether the story was true, however. I could not verify it. So I told it, as it came to me and quoted the Jap butler for what he was worth--nothing more. There are more ridiculous articles being printed by the Screen Writers than two reporters can reply to. They are all of the same type, denying the stories written by us, calling us fakers, picturing us as "trampling the daisies under foot" and proving nothing. However, as Smith has told, the biggest hotel in Los Angeles has given its waiters order to "sap over the head" any actor who "sniffs a nail full of snow, or mixes a drink, or makes a rough crack in the dining room."

Mabel's Reading Matter

February 18, 1922 FARGO FORUM Mabel Normand gave us the best laugh of the week. Did you note the dispatch telling of the fact that a copy of the POLICE GAZETTE was "on the seat of her limousine" while she and her chauffeur were at the curb in front of Mr. Taylor's house? The laugh comes when you consider that this country rewards, with chauffeurs and limousines, movie actresses whose literary tastes run to the POLICE GAZETTE. There is a good secondary laugh in Miss Normand's statement that she respected Mr. Taylor and liked "his views on philosophy." It seemed that he discussed Freud, Haeckel and Nietzsche with her. But that copy of The Police Gazette convinces us that Mr. Taylor did most of the discussing, while Mabel concealed her yawns as best she could. Freud and the POLICE GAZETTE! We'll say that Mabel is certainly catholic in her literary tastes. If you insist on getting excited about the situation, the thing to get excited about, to our way of thinking, is not the fact that Hollywood stages some "wild parties"--they can be found on every Main Street--but the fact that a chit of a girl with a pretty face and an intellect that aspires no higher than the POLICE GAZETTE can earn more in a year than we pay the President of the United States. Surely our standards of values are all wrong. Maybe we ought to pass a law about it, or have a congressional investigation, or something.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 24, 1922 CINCINNATI TRIBUNE Why did Mabel Normand have a copy of the POLICE GAZETTE with her when she called on the slain director? Does not this indicate that she had been to a barber shop immediately before? And if so, could she have taken a copy of The Police Gazette without first slaying the barber?
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 H. G. Salsinger DETROIT NEWS Magazines devoted to motion picture plays and players do a great deal of harm by the nauseating drivel that they print. The silly prattle that is put into the mouths of screen players who are "interviewed" for these magazines and then pen pictures drawn of them are beyond reason. Rex Ingram, a scholar, is not given any better "boost" than a former salesgirl who has suddenly become a headliner. The same superlatives that are used to discuss Ingram are used to describe the brainless cutie whose face is her fortune and whose brain is still in the kindergarten age. It is a long jump from paperbound novels and chewing gum to Plato and Thoreau, but the facile writer of the screen monthlies blithely makes this leap. It must have been with pain and anguish that the screen fans read how Mabel Normand, pictured as a devotee of Voltaire and Nietzsche, testified that on her way to William Taylor's house on the fatal night she stopped at a newstand to buy a bag of peanuts and a copy of the POLICE GAZETTE.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 21, 1922 Scotty FRESNO REPUBLICAN When anybody talks about sounding the heights and depths of well read accomplishment they must be familiar with the literary tastes of Miss Mabel Normand. There is a young lady who reads 'em high and reads 'em low. We read in the public prints that she graciously allowed a reporter to interview her about the visit she made to that movie gentleman out in Hollywood and told the young lad that she had gone there for some reading matter to take home with her, the same being a treatise by a gentleman named Nietzsche who writes long paragraphs full of long words and hard to pronounce. About philosophy, and all such like. Then we are assured by Mabel's chauffeur that another treatise which she had obtained on her visit was a copy of the POLICE GAZETTE. And instantly, and at once, and even sooner we say to ourselves that Mabel is there when it comes to literature. She doesn't cultivate one portion of her brain cells at the expense of the others. She is not going to be the possessor of a single track mind. That her mind shall not be a Jack Spratt and his wife sort of mind, but rather a combination of the Spratt variety wherein both fat and lean shall be furnished. When her eyelids droop over the "will to conquer" sort of highbrowism that Nietzsche deals out she can lightly turn to the POLICE GAZETTE and there fill up on beauty unadorned on the outside cover and learn how Kilrain nearly licked old John L., down on the hot sands of the Gulf of Mexico in the long ago. [10] And view the picture and get the name and address of the most popular barber in Lilliwaup Falls, Wash. Or it may even be that she may send a postal to Box, number something somewhere or other, and beg back word where to send five dollars for a deck of marked cards. Between old Mister Nietzsche and the POLICE GAZETTE it's no wonder that Mabel is nervous and confined to her bed.

***************************************************************************** The Funeral

February 8, 1922 KANSAS CITY TIMES (Los Angeles. Feb. 7.)--Laughter and screams and prayers marked the funeral here today of William Desmond Taylor, murdered motion picture director. With two thousand notables of the screen world and their friends seated within St. Paul's Episcopal Pro-Cathedral, a crowd of thirty thousand without fought for admittance. Failing to gain entrance the vast majority of those left on the outside hemmed the streets and overflowed Pershing square. The police were powerless. And while the Rev. William McCormick, dean of St. Paul's was reading the service and speaking the prayers for the dead prince of Shadowland, shouts and laughter from the jostling, hysterical, riotous throng echoed through the Pro-Cathedral. "Five a bag, they're hot," yelled peanut vendors. Lemonade stands, hastily constructed, were doing a thriving business. As the pallbearers, all men mighty in the film world, carried the casket up the aisle and the great organ began the impressive Handel's "Largo," by some curious irony of fate the strains were mingled with those of a jazz band playing in the Philharmonic auditorium a few hundred feet away. Some of the stars turned their heads at the sound of the jazz, but not a face brightened. This was not a jazz day for them and messengers were quickly sent to the auditorium and the dance music halted.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 BOSTON GLOBE In California a moving picture producer was murdered under circumstances of mystery. His funeral was held in a church. Inside were gathered a party of famous moving picture actors and actresses, and a throng which packed the church to its doors. Outside, in the street, was a crowd of 30,000 people, which the police were powerless to manage. They fought to get into the church, and the reading of the funeral service by the dean of the cathedral was to an accompaniment of the cries of the women caught in the crowd-pack outside. One of the actresses [11] fainted at the end of the funeral, but the crowd was too dense to allow her to be removed from the church. The negro valet of the deceased had a fit of hysterics. There was evidently some misunderstanding about this funeral. It seems to have been mistaken for a moving picture scenario. Such a mistake was perhaps natural, what with the stars, the mob, and the emotional scenes. Yet, however much like a scenario this funeral may have seemed, it was not a scenario--it was a real funeral. And in this fact lies its importance. Try to construct a world conducted according to the principles which seem to govern life in a moving picture scenario, and what would you have? Well, it might be something like society in the moving picture town of Hollywood, Calif,; but it would hardly be like any other place under the moon, unless it were two or three of the livelier circles of Inferno as described by Dante. A world where love-making is the leading industry. Where the souls of gentleman crooks are saved by a species of sex evangelism. Where the poor girl invariably marries the millionaire and experiences no discomforts from the sudden change in her social status. Where every second policeman is a crook; and all rich men's sons are idle and vicious; and every mother-in-law is a she-dragon; and waiters throw pies at complaining diners; where, if a stranger looks squint-eyed at your girl, the correct thing is to paste him one in the eye; and where, if your sentimental affairs get into a snarl, you take poison or else shoot the gentleman who has incurred your displeasure. Try living in such a world--even, if it be only a world of the imagination--for a while, and see the frame of mind you fall into. Is it so strange that the gentleman whose funeral was turned into a movie mob scene should have met such an end? Suppose, innocently or otherwise, he had given offense to an emotional person living in such an hysterical world: what more natural than to translate the scenario into reality, as was done at the funeral itself? The fact is that few worlds have more influence over our conduct than this world of imagination. It is there that we make or unmake ourselves. With our imaginations under the spell of such a fantastic world as that in the scenarios of filmdom, is it any wonder that so many of the daily events which startle and shame us should seem, like this funeral, to have been translated out of that world of riotous imagination into a world of more or less riotous reality?

***************************************************************************** The Investigation

February 4, 1922 LONDON TIMES (Los Angeles)--What the police regard as an important clue was discovered this afternoon. Detectives are investigating a "dope party" given at Hollywood recently, at which cocaine and other drugs were served instead of drinks. Two women, both film actresses, stated that they quarreled over Taylor and fought, ripping the clothes from each other's bodies. Taylor was not present at the party. The police theory is that Taylor's murder was contrived by one of the women, to whose advances he had refused to respond.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 6, 1922 LONG BEACH PRESS "Comb the dope dens of Hollywood!" This terse order was issued today by Detective Captain David L. Adams, following a conference at police headquarters of all agencies working on the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery. It was understood that a new clue had been received connecting the supposed slayer of the famed motion picture director with the operations of a well-organized Hollywood "snowball" ring.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 14, 1922 CLEVELAND PRESS (Los Angeles)--"The queen of the drug fiends" was hunted today in the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery. This woman, head of a powerful drug ring operating in Hollywood, knows the circumstances of Taylor's killing, in the belief of county officials. Efforts to locate the "drug queen" have brought about a thorough search of Chinatown where the "hop" was prepared for the orgies in which its customers indulged. Habitual hangouts of drug addicts were deserted today and all known members of the ring, including its queen, have gone into hiding. Her last place of residence has been searched. A number of interesting names are understood to have been found on her books. The "queen" is described as a woman of beauty who does not show the ravages of the drugs she distributed to the ring's victims. Tracing the woman's movements during the last few months, officers have found she frequently changed her place of residence but that she always lived near Taylor's home.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 17, 1922 NEW YORK NEWS Frisco Jimmie O'Neill, as he described himself to the police, an ex- pugilist and movie actor of Hollywood, Cal., was picked up last night in Chatham Square by Detective Samuel Massam of the Narcotic Squad. O'Neill, the detectives said, had a "deck" of heroin with him which he had just purchased. "I've been in the movies three years," O'Neill told Massam, "and out there at Hollywood the dope got me for fair. We used to go out on the lots and shoot ourselves full of dope. It was the regular thing. "I could get the stuff easy, and the stars and dames used to come to me and beg for it. Many a swell star I've handed a deck of dope to. I knew Taylor, the director, very well, but never worked under him. I left Hollywood the day before he was killed and came East. "I've been getting morph right up to now, but today I fell down and had to make a break for the heroin. The dope has got me for fair, just like it's got a lot of the rest of us that played in the lots out Hollywood way." O'Neill was locked up and will be examined again today by Special Deputy Commissioner Dr. Carleton Simon, in charge of the Narcotic Squad, who questioned him last night about his methods of getting dope both here and in California.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 16, 1922 NEW YORK HERALD William Davis, Mabel Normand's chauffeur, was questioned again today. He told of driving Miss Normand to the apartment court in South Alvarado street, of reaching there about 7:15, of seeing Miss Normand disappear into the court in the direction of Taylor's home, of her reappearance with Taylor after about half an hour, of her chatting with Taylor for a moment at the curb and of the actress's waving good-by as the car moved off. He also told how Henry Peavey, Taylor's butler, left the house while Miss Normand was still there, and of stopping to pass a word with him beside the automobile. This conversation, Davis said today, was brief, for as he comes from the South, he explained, it is not his habit to exchange idle gossip with Southerners of darker hue.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 15, 1922 NEW YORK EVENING WORLD District Attorney Woolwine said today that none of the principles in the case has been exonerated. "I refuse absolutely to go into the question of why numerous persons brought into the case have not been exonerated, in view of their apparent satisfactory statements," he said.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 15, 1922 SAN FRANCISCO CALL-POST Scores of persons, both in and out of filmland, are being quizzed daily by the district attorney without apparent results. One reason cited for the lack of an arrest was that "You've got to be sure of your ground when you jail a movie celebrity." There is an ever growing tendency among those close to the case to marvel at the histrionics displayed by some of those questioned. One investigator today explained the lack of progress by proclaiming almost admiringly and with no little awe, "They lie so beautifully."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 CLEVELAND PRESS "Well, have they got you yet?" is now a frequent greeting in the studios. Some of the stars laugh when asked and some don't.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 24, 1922 SAVANNAH NEWS Great progress is reported in the untangling of the Taylor murder case. It has been rather definitely determined that in all probability there seems to be enough evidence, of a circumstantial if not substantial kind, to believe with some show of moral certainty that there was somewhere, either before or after or during the time of the crime, a woman, in some way, directly or indirectly, mixed up with some of the elements connected with the life of the man who was killed. Probably, more startling still, more than one woman!
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 6, 1922 Edward Doherty NEW YORK NEWS A dainty pink silk nightie which adorned one of the drawers of Taylor's bureau was missing. Nobody could tell who had it. It was hinted, however, that a policeman is keeping it, saying it will bring him good luck.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 7, 1922 DES MOINES REGISTER A dainty pink silk nightgown, bearing three initials of a motion picture star of the first magnitude, is held at police headquarters as the latest clue in the William Desmond Taylor murder case. The gown had been in possession of a police detective who has been quietly working along lines of his own. The little star to whom the garment is said to belong is not a comedienne. She has gained much publicity during the last year because of numerous wealthy and prominent young men who have been seen in her company and to whom she was variously reported as engaged. Hollywood was shocked by the disclosure. The name of the star involved was on every tongue. Taylor's closest friends professed amazement. They were utterly confused, they said, by the discovery and by the facts now coming to light which indicate the complexity of the dead man's past.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 4, 1922 MOVING PICTURE WORLD (reprinted from OTTAWA JOURNAL) It is probable that a fair percentage of those who are most closely following the Los Angeles murder case are more anxious to learn the identity of the owner of the nightdress found in the dead man's apartment than that of the murderer.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 10, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES The belief of detectives that if Edward F. Sands, valet-secretary to William D. Taylor, killed his employer, he was insane, was bolstered last night by information tending to show that the missing fugitive was mentally deranged. "I don't know what I'd do if I lost my job and didn't have any money," Sands is reported to have said. "When I get to be 35 years old I'm going to blow my head off. I don't see any use of people living after that age. They're not good for anything." Sands always carried a .45-caliber Colt revolver, Mr. Brettner said. One morning Mr. Brettner went to Sands's room and found him asleep. He touched him on the shoulder to awaken him. Sands turned over like a flash and pressed the weapon against Mr. Brettner, but when he saw who it was he turned over and went to sleep again without saying a word.

Strathmore, who is believed to be the same man as Edward F. Sands, missing valet of William D. Taylor, murdered motion picture director, were obtained from the two departments today. Strathmore is abnormally marked with double nipples on each breast.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 ST. LOUIS STAR A handkerchief, initialed "S," picked up near the body of Movie Director Taylor, is held as evidence against his former valet, Sands. Without decrying the general case against Sands, we submit that this handkerchief is evidence in his favor. What man ever succeeded in getting or keeping a handkerchief with his own initial on it? The editor of the Star has a dozen or more initialed sneeze-cloths, with letters at intervals from A to W, and not one in the lot could be used as evidence against him if he yielded to his occasional inclination to commit murder.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 14, 1922 LOS ANGELES RECORD This startling story laid before District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine by a bootlegger was under investigation Tuesday: "I was delivering liquor in half-pint bottles at the Taylor bungalow. I was carrying it in two cases used to pack automobile tire inner cases. I approached the front door from the side of the house. As I reached the shrubbery at the front of the house I heard the shot. "I stood for three or four seconds--maybe 10--and I saw a woman leave the Taylor bungalow. She hurried away. "I said to myself: 'This is no place for me,' and I hurried back to my car. I threw the cases into the automobile with such force that I broke a half dozen of the bottles. " 'Let's go' I told my chauffeur and we beat it east down the street."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 12, 1922 CHICAGO TRIBUNE (Los Angeles)--A group of investigators tonight went to dig up the cellar in the Taylor home. They had been told by an anonymous informant that something of great value was hidden in the cellar; something not money, but which would show a connection between certain persons and the slaying. They went out armed with picks and shovels and spades, only to find there was no cellar.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 14, 1922 ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH (Los Angeles)--No official connected with the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery is willing today to declare that any actual progress had been made toward its solution. The officers are at work and still express determination to do their best to find the slayer of the film director, but found themselves confronted with "too many wild tips," they say, and too few genuine clues. Many of these "tips" live through one edition of a newspaper-
-and disappear. The detectives of the Police Department still declare their belief that the case never will be cleared up until Edward F. Sands, the missing former butler-secretary to Taylor, has been discovered. And the Sheriff's deputies are still firm in their contention that Sands had nothing to do with the case. The air is filled with rumors of "mystery men," "mystery women," "mystery witnesses," "drug peddlers," "jealousy motives" and "revenge theories," but back of them all the fact that Sands had not been found: that the murderer has not been arrested, and that the case is still unsolved. The investigation has reached a stage which is described by officials directing the inquiry as of "waiting for the unexpected."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 15, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER After a pitched battle last night between officers and a band of suspected blackmailers and professional gunmen at College Street and North Broadway, eight men were lodged in the County jail where they will be held for investigation and subjected to a severe grilling for possible implication in the William Desmond Taylor slaying.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 6, 1922 ARKANSAS GAZETTE (Los Angeles)--Henry Peavey, by the way, put all his sewing into a satchel this afternoon, his beautiful pillow tops, his exquisite doilies, his crochet work and his tatting, and prepared to depart from the city. He called on Captain Adams to let him know of his intentions. "Not so," said Adams. "You will stay in Los Angeles until released." "I can't stay, captain," said the negro. "I'se very lonesome without Mr. Taylor. I'll sure miss him, captain. Got no one now to squz oranges or lemings for. Got no nice room to do my sewing in. Please let me go." The captain explained that he wanted Peavey to remain as a material witness, and declared that if he tried to go away he might find himself in another nice sewing room, with free board.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 21, 1922 DENVER POST The startling report that a detective has been employed by a big moving picture man to "gum up" the investigation of the murder of William Desmond Taylor, gained circulation late Monday following the latest fiasco in the case. There have been more blunders in the Taylor case than there have been theories--beginning with the doctor who said Taylor died of stomach trouble.

It would seem that after three weeks of continuous smoke screens, the Hollywood hush squad might have chased the investigators farther from the scene of the murder than that.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 17, 1922 CHICAGO AMERICAN (Chicago)--Lou Mary Snyder is a seamstress, ladies' and men's tailor, and can make anything from a handkerchief to a suit of clothes. She was busily stitching away today in her home at 1334 N. Dearborn St. when the telephone rang. "This is the state's attorney," said a voice. "We would like to interview you concerning the Taylor case--" "Yes, I'm a tailor," cut in Miss Snyder. "If it suits you come down to see us at once," the voice continued. "It is in accordance with the request of Mr. Woolwine in Los Angeles." Miss Snyder hurried to the state's attorney's office. She laid out her cloth, got her tape measure and started to fit the state's attorney in a suit. But they insisted on questioning her concerning the murder of William D. Taylor. "Why, I thought you wanted a tailor to make a suit out of wine-colored wool," said the surprised seamstress. She was dismissed as the possible Margaret Snyder the state's attorney's office is seeking. The detectives renewed their search and found the woman Mr. Woolwine was seeking at Rockford, Ill.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 22, 1922 PASADENA STAR-NEWS District Attorney Woolwine's office was in the midst of a probe into the Taylor murder mystery. The telephone ball jangled. W. C. Doran answered. "I gotta hunch on this here murder case!" the mysterious informant told him. "They've got a serum [12] down in Dallas, Texas, that makes people tell the truth. Give 'em a shot in the arm, and veracity spouts like a gusher. Why not give some of those dumb witnesses of yours a dose of that?" Mr. Doran, after some moments of concentrated effort to grasp the idea, burst into laughter. Whereupon the amateur scientist on the other end of the wire, highly indignant, slammed down the receiver.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 15, 1922 Wallace Smith CHICAGO AMERICAN (Los Angeles)--It is now believed that the slayer, before he left Taylor's study, straightened up the room and "laid out" Taylor's body. It was even suggested that a woman may have helped. "She may have been very fond of him," remarked one of the detectives, with a serious face, "and so tried to leave his body as neat as possible. Also the room. You know how women are."

February 14, 1922 CLEVELAND PRESS The Los Angeles police have the Taylor murderer in a net. They are tightening the net. They are not certain of the man's name. They do not know what he looks like. But he is somewhere between New York and Los Angeles and he cannot escape. The police may catch him any hour. But what year, they cannot say.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 OAKLAND TRIBUNE A man was murdered one week ago in Los Angeles. Since then the police authorities have given the most exemplary imitation of polite and tender dealing yet recorded in the annals of crime. The only judgment one can form is that the police are afraid to discover the responsibility for the murderer.

Just as Dr. Doyle's fiction detective used to anathematize the bunglers who destroyed foot-prints, removed clues or allowed priceless indications to pass unobserved, just so, we imagine, the officers concerned in the Desmond Taylor case must feel toward a few score of amateurs, reporters and "nuts" who have messed up the hot trail of the killer. If the murderer of Taylor is ever apprehended, it will be because some skilled and experienced officer, discarding all vague, wild, fantastic and fabricated theories, starts at the ghastly beginning and works forward soberly and carefully toward the end. And in doing that it is almost certain that he will be immensely hampered by the mess of the bunglers who have gone before. It has been stated that clever criminals keep out of the way of the police by reading the newspapers. Certainly if some officers tell as much about their plans as some newspapers would have us believe they must warn their quarry a long time in advance.

It seems as if every one who knew Taylor or could in any fashion be connected with the case has been interrogated at least a half dozen times. The police and the fame-seeking District Attorney of the California metropolis apparently have questioned persons who had no more to do with Taylor's murder than the residents of the Canary Islands. One Woolwine, District Attorney, made what he called an independent investigation, with a camera-man tagging him around and reporters in his following. Woolwine posed in the Taylor house with an assistant taking the part of the picture director--this being done to "reconstruct the crime." How would that help find the criminal? In their efforts the police and the Woolwine force have sent several reputable actresses into retirement, suffering from nervous prostration, and have cast some slight suspicion on a few persons who could not possibly kill another. The time has come for these Los Angeles sleuths and Woolwine and his actors to get off the job, and devote their time to whatever business may be at hand. Skilled detectives should take over the case and follow it to the end. Motion picture makers of Hollywood have raised a fund to hunt down Taylor's slayer, and they can put it to good use by dealing with a reputable detective agency and ignoring the incompetents of the police force and the District Attorney of Los Angeles.

Love Letters [1]

February 9, 1922 ST. LOUIS STAR "I love you, I love you, I love you," wrote the movie actress to the late film director, thereby proving that movie actresses do, after all, have a pretty large vocabulary.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 10, 1922 Bide Dudley NEW YORK EVENING WORLD In our opinion the love letter, so-called, written by Mary Miles Minter to Taylor, the film director, who was murdered, means nothing at all of importance. Being personally acquainted with Mary and her family, we are familiar with the little film star's nature and we are sure she might write just such a letter to any man friend who had been her benefactor and admirer. She would mean nothing by it other than an expression of such love as a happy- go-lucky girl might have for her father or an uncle. Everybody calls Mary "Dear," and every good friend of hers, male or female, kisses her when they meet. In the theatrical and film world a kiss isn't a very serious affair. Mary has always been a carefree innocent girl, closely chaperoned by her mother, a very estimable Southern lady. We saw Mary in New York last June, just before she sailed for Europe, and in front of fifty people at a dinner at the Hotel Biltmore she kissed us. We mention this so that, after we are shot, it won't be used to besmirch the reputation of Mary Miles Minter, who is today just as sweet and innocent as she was when she appeared as the barefoot kiddie in "The Littlest Rebel" eight years ago.

Down Los Angeles way the sudden taking off of a motion picture director has revealed in superlative quantity the common impulse that exists to let the emotions expand under the witching stimulus of a flowing pen. One love letter is very like another; in this one thing the world changeth never. It has all been said. Dido might have held the pen of Mabel Normand in the hour she suspected Aeneas had his mind set on his famous getaway; Cleopatra might have written like the Minter girl when Antony's eye seemed to be roving a trifle free. Nothing original is to be found in love- letters, probably because there is nothing original in love. This is not astonishing. The thing that bemuses understanding is that in this day of highly-developed inventive genius no substitute has been adopted for the paper-and-pen love letter. What is disappearing ink for if not kindly to erase the follies of yesterday under the blushing second though of today? Should it not be a Medean law that all love letters are returnable to the sender by registered return mail, special delivery? Apparently the itch to write may not be appeased and the letters must be written; but must we and our children and generations yet unborn forever read and re-read the eternal secret of what one person thinks of another in that "first fine careless rapture," or otherwise, which is found in the love letter?

How many tragedies would be averted if these two simple lines were followed. And now the latest one is filling the pages of the press, in which a murder was committed, and in which love letters play a highly prominent part. Doubtless Mabel Normand is at present wishing she had never written those letters to William D. Taylor, because of the great trouble they have already caused her in this complex situation. People do not realize how silly they can be until they read over the love letters that they wrote long after the love is gone. And when they appear in cold type, in the headlines of a newspaper, they look foolish indeed. Only a person who has been the writer can understand the feeling of seeing his lovelorn missives, written at midnight, just after seeing him or her, finally brought out in the broad daylight where everybody can see them. Young people should be very careful to whom they write love letters. Better say it with words and save the pricks, that come from a pen-point. As to the case mentioned, I cannot help wishing that Mr. Taylor had either burned Miss Normand's letters or returned them to her. Had he followed the wisdom of the great poet of his country, he would not have failed to do this. For Kipling has wisely put this way as the only way for a gentleman to follow: "If She have written a letter, delay not an instant, but burn it."

Because, as one of them said to me--she's engaged to a film star--no matter how innocuous your letters may be, if you're in love with a man you're just bound to write mushy stuff that would look awfully silly in print.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 11, 1922 NEW YORK MAIL Certain tender missives found in the rooms of a man who was murdered in California are causing no end of trouble for the ladies who wrote them. Even though they may be nothing more than innocent expressions of pure affection, the authors doubtless are agonizing over the possibility that they may be read by a laughing public. It makes little difference that about 98 per cent of the adult readers have written love notes themselves. There is a curious quirk in the average mind that always regards a love letter--another's love letter, of course--as funny. Yet boys and girls go on writing them, and so do men and women, and every once in a while they keep turning up at awkward moments to plague the writers beyond measure. What, then! Shall people stop writing them? Heaven forbid! When love itself goes out of fashion, when moonlight and starshine cease to play pranks with the emotions, when a scented envelope loses its charm, when men are too cold to thrill and women too indifferent to please, when sense has outlawed sensibility, when all the Omars shall cling only to barren reason--then and not until then shall the love note be outlawed, without benefit of clergy. Discretion, to be sure, would prevent the sending of many a dainty confection of words, but who is Discretion that he should pretend to be a lover? It was of Discretion that Hafiz was thinking when, as Kipling translates him, he advises that a letter from "Her" should be burned, adding: "Tear it to pieces, O Fool, and the wind to her mate will return it." But just now the question is not of letters to any "Her" who has an obstreperous mate in the background. It was Emerson--or was it?--who advised one to walk ten miles before writing one letter. But that is nonsense. There is a better and safer way than that, if one must court safety. And that is to write the letter, to put one's soul into its composition, to write singing words fit for Philomel's melody--and then to tear it up without sending it.

***************************************************************************** Frozen Horror

February 8, 1922 LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL Moviedom's New Art Taylor, the Hollywood movie director, will not have died in vain if his death shall have taught some of the screen "stars" to act. Mary Miles Minter, who admits she wrote to Taylor scented notes laden with X's and "I love you--I love you--I love you," discovered, by looking into a mirror, that she could act when she heard of Taylor's murder. "It was terrible," says Mary. "I rushed at once to my mirror and looked at my face. I was appalled. I kept the expression and hurried to mama. " 'Mama,' I cried, 'did you ever see this expression on my face before?' " 'No,' she said. 'It is perfect frozen horror. You've never done it before.' " [4] Now if Mary can only keep that frozen horror in cold storage until she can get it on the screen in her next picture, movie fans may yet see on Mary's face something which, like Mary's mother, they never saw there before. And if Mary has been stirred to deep facial emotion by Taylor's taking off, is it not likely that many, many other screen stars were similarly stirred? Mary was only one of those stars whose orbits encircled Taylor. It may be that these others lacked Mary's thought to rush to mirrors and inspect their faces when they heard of Taylor's assassination: that they failed to grip the frozen horrors thus revealed and before they melted hurry away to mammas or other witnesses just as good. But no doubt they have learned a lesson from Mary and will be better prepared to improve their opportunity the next time one of their dear ones is snuffed out. Probably they could cut out the rush to mirrors, for do they not carry mirrors around with their powder rags, anyway; while as for mamma, to make sure of having her within reaching distance before the thaw, couldn't they declare a Pekingeses holiday and attach the leash to mamma? There would seem to be great possibilities of Mary's discovery how to acquire new facial expressions. In a free and easy colony like Hollywood it ought not be difficult to provide for the slaughter of some loved one whenever a star feels the need of a shock that will be good for a frozen horror or other similar tragic refrigeration. Moreover, this field for the renaissance, or origination, of the art of acting in moviedom which Miss Minter has opened up is by no means limited to the production of emotions of horror and grief. It should be even more fertile in products of joy, exultation and ecstasy. If a star could fill an icehouse with frozen horror for use in the films by having one of her lovers snickersneed, [5] she could lay in a yet more plentiful stock of joy by having one of her enemies kiboshed. And with its rivalries and jealousies, moviedom abounds even more in enemies than in lovers. None of its stars would ever be at a loss to pick out an enemy for the butcher whenever she felt the need of a boost of her joy emotions. The supply of enemies would last as long as moviedom lasted. There would be the rub. With such a system of stimulating acting in practice, how long would moviedom--Hollywood, at least--last? Might not Hollywood, by the incessant slaughter of lovers and enemies, ultimately be exterminated? Even so, there seem to be some people who would not be inconsolable for that. For instance, there is that Eastern moving picture magnate, Herbert Brenon, who thinks "it would be a jolly good thing if Hollywood were abolished" at once. [6]
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 10, 1922 LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL For the broadening of Mary Miles Minter's newly discovered art it is a pity that this twinkling screen star was not in rushing distance of a mirror so that she could have discovered what was the frozen expression on her face when she saw that Mabel Normand beat her to it and fainted dead away right there in front of the whole show at the Taylor funeral.

Poor Miss Minter could not tell how she felt until she saw her face. Even then she needed mama to tell her it was an emotion she had never "registered" before. It's fortunate the news didn't come while Mary Miles Minter was in the dark, for then she never would have known just how she did take it. The death of loved human beings has been a most fertile source of artistic expression. The poetry, prose, music and drama of the world would suffer irreparably if they were deprived of their eulogistic pieces. It remained for Miss Minter, however, to invent a new form of artistic eulogy--the frozen-horror movie face.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 19, 1922 LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL Bon Voyage, Mary! Dear Mary Miles Minter, who made famous the frozen-horror face, has sailed for Honolulu, Hong Kong and other points east. So far as can be learned, she has packed her emotions in her suitcase, fearing to leave them behind on her bureau. It's never safe to be separated long from one's emotions. While some of them are preserved by freezing, others are known to melt, disintegrate and decay. With her emotions, Mary Miles has placed her mirror. There they are side by side, so that when Mary tries on an emotion, she can see its effect immediately and thus find out just how she is feeling. For example, if she nestles in a quiet corner of the hurricane deck and is subjected to the blandishments of the flirts that haunt the seven seas, she should have her emotional kit by the side of her steamer chair. Otherwise, she'd be at a dead loss to react in the proper manner, being wholly ignorant of her feelings until she looks in the mirror. In this connection, a theory regarding this charming damsel has been conceived. It will be remembered that when the news of the death of her friend, William Desmond Taylor, was brought to her, she not only registered perfect frozen horror, but was able to carry the expression to her mamma and have it interpreted. It is said by close analysis of Mary Miles' makeup that the term "frozen" is not strictly accurate, but is merely used as a metaphor. It is said, further, in explanation of this gift of preserving an expression, that Mary Miles has no trouble at all in exercising it. Mary Miles, they say, is concrete from the neck upward and impressions upon such a skull last extraordinarily well. A pleasant voyage to Mary Miles!

February 5, 1922 Skye T. Errier CHICAGO TRIBUNE The American Occupation of Movieland Movieland, Southern California.--The marines have landed and have the situation well in hand. The devil dogs constitute the Army of Occupation of Movieland and will remain here until peace has been established and Movieland formally annexed to the United States. All bars have been closed and the marines are now raiding the peanut stands. No unpleasant incident occurred during the occupation except the burning of the beautiful library belonging to one of the native queens, consisting of two books, one by Nietzsche, the other by Freud, a telephone directory, and a copy of the Police Gazette. A large number of the chiefs and natives assembled this afternoon, and I read to them the provisions of the Volstead act, which they had never heard of before. They cheered vociferously until they discovered that it also applied to cocktails. I also read them the constitution of the United States, and they thought it was very pretty. They seem to be a good natured people, willing to obey our laws as soon as they find out what they are. A large number of the inhabitants have expressed the wish to go to America, and have offered to take the oath of allegiance, but as most of them are being held as witnesses to something or other, their requests could not be complied with. Some of the inhabitants are demanding a plebiscite, but I do not think that the claims of America to sovereignty on the ground that the country formerly belonged to the United States will be forcibly disputed.

A drastic curfew law has been put in force and all the inhabitants of Movieland are required to be in their houses by 7 o'clock in the evening. This drastic rule caused much excitement, as most of the residents of this strange country were not in the habit of getting up until that hour unless they were posing in a picture. The provost marshal issued an announcement today that caused much comment. "The night," said the provost marshal, "is the time for sleeping." The natives of Movieland said they never heard of such an outlandish thing. The provost marshal also declared that February, March and April must be regarded as closed months for grouse, quail, directors, scenario writers, black bear, tourists and game of all kind. Whether or not these will be permitted to be shot in the future rests on Will Hays, the new governor-general of Movieland, who has not yet arrived. Movieland is fast becoming Americanized, and its annexation can be looked for in the near future.

If Hollywood is to be made safe for democracy it must get over its absurd idea of modesty, its chronic distaste of publicity. The inhabitants must come out in the open, give their names to the papers and not shrink like wild violet from the white light of the public gaze. We hope by our example to cure them. I trust I make myself clear." The expedition will return to civilization in about six weeks.

This was the warning issued today by Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford in response to questions concerning Hollywood. The real stars in Hollywood never heard of a dope ring, asserted the hero and heroine of the Fairbanks family, and both of them agreed on this statement: "Unless an intolerant public and press cease attaching to a manufacturing industry, such as the cinema, the stigma of narcotic smoke, scrambled domesticity, night time orgies, purple loves and freely distributed bank-notes, Paris, or perhaps the South Sea Islands, will be the future home of the camera setups. "Motion pictures make up an industry in which money is worked for and not inherited. If the United States does not like us there are other countries that do. "Paris was made famous by the same vicious reports which are being hurled against Hollywood. In the case of Paris, as in this, the revelers in nine cases out of ten were American or British visitors to the city. "Real estate in Hollywood will take a leap."

We take that as a personal insult. Here we are trying to amuse the people, endeavoring to make them smile or laugh and along come these two stealing our stuff. They are butting in on our preserves and we object. How on earth can we run a column supposed to be slightly humorous at times when we have such competition right on the first page of our own paper? We never laid any claims to the ability to produce shrieks of laughter, but we have tried faithfully until this blow. We have read Artemus Ward, Joe Miller, Mark Twain, Life, Main Street, Irv Cobb's stories, Ring Lardner, George Ade and a host of other humorists, but theirs are funeral orations compared with Mary's and Doug's remarks. We don't want to play in your yard, We don't love you any more; You'll be sorry when we leave you, To shoot our scenes on tropic shore. We don't like the way you treat us, We are angels, don't you see; Just you watch how swell they'll greet us, When we move to dear Paree. When we recovered from hysterics after reading the effusion of the two, we thought that it was rather rough on the South Sea Islands to pick them for one of the possible destinations of the movies. Paris isn't so bad, because Paris might have a say in the matter, but the poor, little, defenseless South Sea Islands! What have they ever done to the movies! We are thinking seriously of asking Doug and Mary to run the column some day. If they can keep up the pace they have set for rich and rare humor, it ought to be a humdinger from start to finish. If the hegira takes place (that's a fancy word meaning getaway) "real estate in Hollywood will take a leap," says Mary and Doug. A leap for joy? It's all right for movie people to come to the defense of movie people, but when they threaten to take their toys and go home, that's different. Why not pick China for the abode of future operations? Think how nice it would sound to be able to pressagent that some of the stars were receiving 6,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,001 yen a month for their work!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 7, 1922 ARIZONA GAZETTE Mountains and Molehills California newspapers, and especially those of Los Angeles, are running wild over the recent shooting there, under mysterious circumstances, of a motion-picture director named W. D. Taylor. The columns of the Los Angeles dailies have literally reeked with sensationalism for several days, the first pages being given over, to a great extent, to the exploitation of this new morsel of criminal chronology. To say that this sort of stuff which the California papers are playing up is sickeningly nauseating to the average reader is putting it mildly. Why is such prominence given to this comparatively obscure killing? Certainly the dead man's position did not warrant it. It is safe to say that very few persons not connected with the motion-picture industry knew anything of this man Taylor or whatever his real name may have been. He may have been a good director. Probably he was. For that he deserves sufficient praise. So would a good ditch digger or a good carpenter or a good surveyor or any other man who achieved success in his particular line of endeavor. Buy why magnify his importance out of all proportion, merely for the sake of creating a sensation? Taylor was not a great man; not even a prominent man. His name meant nothing to the nation. And yet, for the sake of yellow sensationalism, and possibly to cause reflections upon the motion-picture industry and those eminently worthy and respectable persons engaged therein, the newspapers are flaunting this case in the face of the world as the sensation of the age. They are making a mountain of muck out of a mere molehill. Faugh! It is sickening!

Names of film actresses and other personages of the movie world have been dragged in. Silly letters said to have been written by one of them have been quoted. Alleged clues have been exhibited. Long stories have been written about possibilities. Almost, one is inclined to suspect that the "news" has been produced by professional scenario writers whose specialty has been to manufacture stories for serial reels of the blood-and- thunder variety. Manifestly the suggestion is in order that the output of words be checked, and not be permitted to flow again unless and until the murderer is caught.

Cynics who have a good opinion of neither the movie colony nor the newspapers may claim that neither course is possible.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 10, 1922 OAKLAND TRIBUNE A Reporter at Hollywood Wishing to solve this Southern mystery we have sent one of our most trusted sleuths to Hollywood with instruction to break away the film, film directors and huskies who surround the case and give us the facts. His first dispatch follows: Sir:--I have arrived here disguised as a cowboy willing to accept a $100,000 salary during the winter grazing season and, at once was given the entree to movieland. Except for twelve hundred reporters I am the only one who is, as you might say, on the ground floor. Frankly, I am without a theory. My training led me at first to suspect the butler but as he is not here to turn white and to run his fingers around his collar, I am not so sure. Men in one movie camp tell me the most likely suspects are in the others and the Los Angeles reporters have it that anybody is a suspect whose picture looks well on the front page. The recipe for writing a story is three parts dope, to one part bootleg. Stir well and add tobasco. It is a good recipe as it brings a new result each day. You may say for my readers that I am supplied with a number of disguises and an immense determination, that I am followed hourly by press agents and that whatever I say will be up to the accepted standard for reliability.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 11, 1922 CHICAGO POST People are interested in movie stars because they know them by sight. So the latest crime in Hollywood movie circles has had an unusual drawing power as news. But for lack of progress in the detection of the criminal, certain Chicago papers have begun to vie with each other in the turning up of foulness and degeneracy, and in the brazen openness and cynicism with which they have forced on their decent readers all sorts of filthy gossip about depravity and unnatural vice. None of it is fit to print. It is getting hard to tell which are the most demoralized and demoralizing, the overpaid, underbalanced decadents who form a lunatic fringe of the movie world, or the cynical scandalmongers of the Chicago press.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * May 1922 PHOTOPLAY During the investigation in the Taylor murder case, when each day the sensational newspapers would come out with fresh "clues" and scandals only to cast them aside the day following for new ones, a certain noted motion picture star was approached by reporters of a Los Angeles daily with an interesting proposition. They wanted him to "disappear" over the Mexican border so that the paper might run a sensational story fixing the guilt temporarily upon him. Of course, they said, he could return immediately and be cleared by an alibi. The idea behind the proposition was that the star would get a lot of free publicity and the newspaper would get a corking new yarn to excite the fans--and, consequently, sell the paper. But they picked on the wrong star. The gentleman they chose--we will call him Mr. M. [8]--hurled the reporters out of the room. Another paper got wind of the stunt and attempted to interview Mr. M., but he refused on the ground that too much sensational stuff had been woven about the unfortunate tragedy.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 13, 1922 OAKLAND TRIBUNE Our Correspondent Hollywood.--There is nothing more promising than the clues they have here. In spite of reports to the contrary, I find all the police officers, detectives, strong-arm men and press agents most accommodating. They press clues upon me from all sides until the task that is left for me is draw the right one out of the pile. To set at rest some wild rumors, I made a personal investigation today. They do not deliver dope to the Hollywood back doors in milk wagons. There are no pipe lines of booze in any of the bungalows to which I have been invited, and the bootleggers do not exactly fight for first privileges at the newcomer. They draw lots or shake dice like gentlemen. The longer I work on this case the more I am convinced that I am as good a detective as there is on the job. Perhaps I am better--for I know nothing to conceal.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 8, 1922 HOLLYWOOD NEWS Hearst Circulation in Hollywood Should Be Zero As has been generally expected, the Los Angeles Examiner has broken into print with another exhibition of vulgar language directed against the film colony of Hollywood in their follow-up of the William D. Taylor murder. Perhaps a reprint of one of the most obnoxious remarks might better serve the purpose of showing the folks of the movie colony just what is being said against them. Here is what the Examiner has to say anet motion-picture directors when speaking of certain night clothes found in William D. Taylor's bungalow: "Taylor never wore those nighties, yet few nights passed that they were not worn, according to the police. Sands knew that Taylor was no better than any other film director in Los Angeles." It is an outrage to Hollywood. Hearst papers should be choked off here until the local circulation is just what the little boy hit when he shot at the bird--nothing.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 14, 1922 NEW YORK HERALD (Los Angeles)--District Attorney Woolwine today made a statement in which he deplored what he termed "faked and fraudulent interviews" on the case, and particularly one purporting to have come from him. His statement follows: "In the early edition of the Examiner for Monday morning there appeared on the first page an interview purporting to come from me which was never in effect given. "This interview never took place and there is not a word of it that I have ever authorized to be printed nor did I have the slightest intimation, directly or indirectly that it would be. "There is not a sentence that contains my exact language about anything. It is composed of some things that I have uttered in substance. There are some half truths, many absolute falsehoods. Language purported to have been uttered by me is out of whole cloth and is viciously false. "It is certainly an outrage for any newspaper to be guilty of such a faked and fraudulent interview. "I am informed that this fake has been telegraphed all over the United States, which magnified its iniquity."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 26, 1922 LOS ANGELES TIMES Lauding to the skies Hollywood and its motion-picture industry in his Los Angeles papers and reviling them in his Eastern sheets as a pesthole of iniquity and as the dregs and offscourings of the lowest type of social criminals, William Randolph Hearst has reached new heights of journalistic hypocrisy--for revenue only. No praise is too fulsome or extravagant for Heart's LOS ANGELES EXAMINER to heap upon the film industry in Los Angeles, its home. No insults are too gross or baseless to hurl at that same Los Angeles industry in Hearst's CHICAGO AMERICAN and his dozen-odd other eastern papers. The damage done to Los Angeles by the circulation of these unfounded libels is past computation. Nor has Hearst the excuse that his eastern reports are prepared at a distance by writers not in a position to get the facts. These reports have every one been written by Hearst employees in Los Angeles working out of the Los Angeles Examiner building and using the Hearst wires from this city. That they are recognized as unbridled fabrications is proven by the fact that the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER, which has to live here, has printed not a line of them.

***************************************************************************** "The Humor of a Hollywood Murder", Part 6

Evil Hollywood

February 9, 1922 DETROIT FREE PRESS There seem to be two ways in which the Hollywood situation may be handled by the producers. One is by cleansing the colony so effectively that the world will believe it is purified. The other is by uprooting it from the face of the earth. On the whole the latter course seems much the simpler.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 26, 1922 OMAHA BEE Drive Garbage Element From Movies Protesting the alleged scandalous actions of certain movie stars in Hollywood, the Motion Picture Theater Owners' Association of America has issued the following statement: "There should be some effective way to remove the garbage element from the producing end of the motion picture business. The elimination of the dirty birds who have befouled the high positions into which the theater owners and public boosted them must be accomplished in some way. "The odium of their malodorous conduct falls on the theater owner and this polluting group must no longer be permitted to hang their smeared linen on this exhibitors' line. It must be made plain to the public that the theater owners are not responsible for the conduct of these human filth gushers in the industry, that we utterly repudiate them and demand their removal from every place where their foul presence tends to contaminate our business. "Now we have the Taylor murder with its divorce attachment, alias appendages, multiplicity of actresses, jealous and other scandalous circumstances involving well-known stars. The possibility of a well-known producer being mixed in confronts us and the whole mess of tragic obscenity is nauseating. [1] "The belief in some quarters that the motion picture business is on the one side festering with crass immorality and on the other distended with bulgy and bulky money bags makes it very essential that theater owners become alive to the situation confronting them. It must be emphasized that theater owners are not responsible for these conditions and that they will keep faith with the public, that no person tainted with scandal shall appear in actor guise or otherwise on our screens."

"Girls all over the country are longing to get into the movies," Herrick said. "And whether they succeed or not their minds are perverted and their morals loosened by what their favorite screen stars are doing." Herrick has introduced a bill to tax all moving picture producers and theatres fifty per cent of their net profits.

Were the Hollywood colony in peril of the divine wrath, Lot would have to strike a sharp bargain. Many men have told me in all seriousness that movieland is a smear on American decency. Others who have followed the game closely for years have said that, were it not for the cleansing air of Southern California, the stench of the movies would asphyxiate clean-minded America.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 20, 1922 BUFFALO EXPRESS Speaking on the sanctity of human love last evening at the Central Presbyterian Church, the Rev. Dr. Robert J. MacAlpine, the pastor, said: "Untainted love is the divinest thing this side of heaven. But tainted love is born of Hades. It has disgraced Hollywood. It threatens the very life center of the film world. "The recent moral revelations in California's movie realm shocked the self-respecting world. But, had it not been for the death tragedies in star circles, there would have been no revelation and no shock. The unsuspecting public would have moved on in peaceful ignorance. And undisturbed the malignant virus would have still gone on eating its cancerous way into the body vitals of American life. "Did physical conditions exist with such destructive virulence, the state would long ago have quarantined the infested quarters and restricted the liberties of the infected parties. Public sentiment itself would have demanded it as a necessary protection to the health of society. Worse than such a pestilence has been running rampant in Hollywood. By accident, or incident, it has only recently been brought to light. And now no less is it necessary to protect society from its contagious germ. The whole cinematic bottom needs thorough housecleaning and disinfecting. If it doesn't get it, nothing short of moral disaster will follow. For, from the rotten source, the moral taint will appear on the screen in every city and hamlet in the land. If it be allowed to continue, society will pay the penalty by moral disintegration and decay. And this fair republic will reap the harvest of untold moral disease and pain and death. Nothing on earth is more certain."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 11, 1922 PHILADELPHIA RECORD Loose Los Angeles It is possible that within the limits of the city of Los Angeles there are some people of refinement who deplore the flood of notoriety that has come upon the place, culminating in the tidal wave that found its crest in the melodramatic passing of William Desmond Taylor--or whatever his real name may have been. But no one would be able to guess this from the news dispatches that have been pouring out of that storm center into every little backwater community that maintains a printing press. The voice of Los Angeles speaks through the megaphone of the movie director. The municipal authorities either sing small or take their cue from the dominant orator. The Mayor of the city recently felt it incumbent upon him to announce to the world, or to such small part of the world as might give ear to his words in the clamor of more interesting voices, that Los Angeles was proud to be the capital of the moving picture world. Proud? Of what? There is nothing in Hollywood that any reputable city might be proud of, except the money it brings to the neighborhood--and it is this money which is responsible for the evils of which Hollywood now stands convicted. It is remarkable that Hollywood should have any defenders at all; and yet one intelligent and sophisticated observer was recently moved to remark, in effect, that moral defections on the part of members of the movie world were no more worthy of reprehension than the forging of a check, or any other criminal lapse on the part of a clergyman would be. Again we come round to the eternal "root of all evil"--the love of money. Easy money, pouring lavishly into the pockets of those who have been unaccustomed to it, is at the bottom of the shame of Los Angeles. At Hollywood is gathered a vast colony of men and women who receive incomes out of all proportion to their intellectual merits. Flattery and admiration are lavished upon them far beyond their deserts. Their community has become, naturally enough, a nest of neurotic noxiousness. The whole place needs a healthy fumigation. There are among these men and women, to be sure, some worthy, self- respecting actors and actresses who should not be condemned with the majority; but they are, unfortunately, the minority. They were prompt to declare that Hollywood must have a thorough housecleaning, but, as we remarked above, theirs is not the voice at the megaphone. Unfortunately, too, most of us who prefer to listen to the voice of the movie director, and to the printed words of his abettors in certain newspapers, have large and furry ears. The public has been a good deal of a jackass in its unlimited adoration of the film stars; and so to that extent, at least, it is responsible for the present deplorable state of the community which the pious first explorers called the "City of the Angels."

He demanded passage by congress of a resolution to investigate the film colony and prevent its scandals from debauching the mind of America. "Actors and actresses of the screen," he charged, "are teaching the public free love, adultery, murder, infidelity and lust.

Pointing his finger at Senator Walker, Canon Chase said: "It's time that the people of this State were told how much you, as a paid representative of the movie interests in the Legislature, are receiving." "It's absolutely none of your business," replied Senator Walker. "Well, I think they are entitled to know how much you are getting from the movie interests," retorted Canon Chase. "I tell you it's none of your business what I get from the motion picture interests, any more than it is any business of mine what you get in your collections," Senator Walker exclaimed. "Remember, Senator, that you are a member of the Senate," said Canon Chase. "Yes, I am a Senator by election of the people, and not a self-ordained lobbyist like you are," replied Senator Walker. "I appear at this hearing as a citizen," Canon Chase said. "You've been here most of the time as a disturber," retorted the Senator. Then he talked about the accusation that he had received a salary from the moving picture interests. "Well, maybe I have bragged about it, as you say, and I'll brag about it from here to California and back, if I want to, but I want you to understand once and for all that it's none of your business how much I get," said Senator Walker. In addition to Canon Chase, Joseph Levensen, Secretary to the Motion- Picture Censorship Commission spoke. "If you think the present law is too weak," Secretary Levensen said, "then you can add a section which would give the commission authority to eliminate all movie stars who do not bear respectable reputations. I suppose if you gave us that power about 50 per cent of the stars would be eliminated."

February 10, 1922 Estelle Lindsey LOS ANGELES EXPRESS While Mabel Normand, in a darkened room slept the sleep of exhaustion A. McArthur, publicity director for the Sennett studios and the Cerebus at present standing between the star and the press, today dictated this statement: "Miss Normand and Taylor never were in love with each other. Why in the name of sense do the newspapers keep on harping on that silly stuff? "Miss Normand was never engaged to Mack Sennett and he never was jealous of Taylor." "Mrs. John Borden of Chicago, claiming to be a close friend of Miss Normand, claims that Miss Normand was engaged to Sennett," I suggested. "Then she was talking nonsense," was the emphatic retort. "I didn't mean to say anything further for publication, but I'll say that. All we are trying to do is to keep the poor little girl's name out of the papers. Every time it occurs in connection with the murder it injures her." "What about the statement of Underwood, arrested in Topeka? He says a woman killed Taylor. Has Miss Normand any theories on that subject?" McArthur turned about and made a gesture of utter disgust. "The poor nut," he blurted. "Underwood is crazy, bughouse. His statement is bunk, just bunk. "Honest, we are not going to give out any more statements for Miss Normand. We are not going to deny or affirm. We are tired, burned out. "Walter Underwood is just a poor boob. Why should we care what he says?" "Are you certain Miss Normand is asleep?" I inquired. "She should be," replied Mr. McArthur, peeping between some heavy velvet curtains that separated the living-room from a rear chamber. "Yes, she's asleep and I wish the gossip was as quiet. That's all. "For God's sake, keep the girl's name out of this mess."

--Movie Publicity Man in Recent Interview) The Publicity Man wore a pair of gumshoes [2] and his suit was the somberest black. He walked down the alley and looked all about that nobody followed his track. He had on a mask and his cap was pulled down and you never would know it was he. He came in the back door with a soft, stealthy step, as quiet as quiet could be. He looked all about and he stole up the stairs where the dramatic editor sat. His tread was so light and his knock on the door was the quietest rat-a-tat-tat. And the editor asked what the news of the stars, for he knew there must be, more or less. The Publicity Man whispered low and he said: "Sh-h-h! We are keeping their names from the press!" The Publicity Man had no picture or scroll or lay-out or story or such. He was mum as an oyster and still as could be with a blue pencil fast in his clutch. And the editor said: "I will run a weird tale of the slim stars and short ones and stout." The Publicity Man all a-tremble and pale, said: "Oh, Editor, pray, cut it out!" The the Editor said: "What's the matter, old boy? What's the which and the why and the how?" "The stars want a rest," so the other replied. "There is too much publicity now! We have had so much stuff of their furs and their gowns and their hair and their winning red lips. Till they're simply worn out with the strain of it all and just now all they want is eclipse." The Publicity Man gathered up all the stuff that the editor had on his hook And he looked all about and he whispered goodby with a frightened and furtive look. Then he put back his mask and he stole out the door and he dropped down a coal hole to hide. For the soul of the man was all stricken and sad, and all humbled and sore was his pride. Then he came out at dark and he gumshoed his way to the place where he wrote his weird stuff And he turned out the lights and he sat in the dark and he said: "I'm an old bird and tough, And I've seen some of life as it comes and it goes, as much as a man can, I guess, But I never once thought in the whole of my days I'd be keeping things out of the press."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 6, 1922 Edward Doherty NEW YORK NEWS (Los Angeles)--There are hundreds of substantial citizens who believe the movie interests would spend millions of dollars not to catch the murderer; but to prevent the real truth from coming out. They fear that with the revelations coming out of the mystery, the doings of other film actors and actresses may become known, and these are things that would wipe out many a fair reputation once they got into circulation. They fear that there might be some misunderstandings if the fans learned about those very free moonlight parties, sometimes held in the Beverly Hills district, where nymphs and naiads dance in costumes made purely of melting moonbeams.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 10, 1922 BALTIMORE AMERICAN (Los Angeles)--The casualties brought to light by the probe of the Taylor murder mystery continue to mount. Mabel Normand has suffered a nervous breakdown. Mary Miles Minter is so weak from grief that she has to be barricaded in her home. Claire Windsor has a severe attack of insomnia. And now comes the report that husky Mack Sennett is ill, too ill to be seen, too ill to talk. Meanwhile the district attorney is talking rather bluntly about a "conspiracy of silence" in the Taylor case.

Newspaper men are met with a wall of silence at every turn. One reporter was sent on a three weeks' vacation today to commune with nature after a nervous collapse in attempting to solve the mystery.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 11, 1922 OAKLAND TRIBUNE Our Correspondent Afield (Hollywood)--I have visited the police station where is kept the famous carpet and the famous grill. With each passing hour a new suspect is placed upon this carpet and with each hour the police begin, all over again, a "gruelling examination." There is no one in Hollywood today who can claim to any position among his fellows unless he has been grilled most gruellingly. Outside of this grill room it is more difficult to find a policeman than a suspect. They have run to a convenient cover furnished by the united society of film magnates. In the evening, as I sit here writing this only true account of the famous case, I can hear the sh-shish-ing of these magnates and their corps of agents, a shishing that is proving very effective. Over the wave of slush, one might say, has come a wave of shish. No man dare say his soul is his own if that soul is under contract to the movies. I am determined to solve the puzzle--but first I shall find it.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 PITTSBURGH POST (Los Angeles)--The dynamic energy of the police in the fruitless search for the solution of the mysterious murder of William Desmond Taylor was exceeded today by the massed and hurricane activity of the kings of the film industry to ring down the curtain on the unceasing flow of scandal that has surrounded the tragedy. The police centered their search on meager clues that ended in blind alleys--mysterious pink nighties that disappear--initialed handkerchiefs that cannot be found--hints of secret loves of beautiful and unnamed women stars-- rejected lovers--scented love letters-- The chain is endless. Throughout Hollywood the great men of the industry were closeted with men and women idols of the screen, making every effort to hush up the scandal. Giddy parties in the fast road house resorts have been cancelled. The lights of the white light cabarets no longer shine on decolleted and shimmy loving women of the screen.

Various cliques who formerly disparaged one another are now firmly united in the declaration that its people are just about the grandest little bipeds that ever stepped on the gas. Moreover, it has been brought home to the celluloid denizens even more forcefully than after the Arbuckle case that hereafter they must walk a chalk line without waving their arms wildly.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 BUFFALO NEWS (New York)--"One hundred million American dollars invested in the film industry are endangered by the acts of a dozen or so wastrels and degenerates," Carl Laemmle, one of the greatest movie magnates, declared today. "There are thousands of good girls and upright men in Hollywood. And we're not going to stand for the scandalous few. They stick out like a sore thumb. And we'll chop off that sore thumb."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 6, 1922 BUFFALO NEWS (Buffalo)--Censorship was a topic on which Miss Lillian Gish declined to comment. "Please don't make me talk about censorship," she said. "I am paid to act, not to think." Hollywood is another topic that hasn't any particular interest to her, Miss Lillian declared. "Of course there are bad men and women in the film industry," she asserted. "Why, even the weather is bad now and then. There are bad men and women in every walk of life. But I do think the press does wrong when it overplays the scandals and crimes of picture people."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * April 1, 1922 Irma MOVIE WEEKLY Romance in the movie colony is so pale, these days. Nobody is admitting being engaged to wed. They seem to feel that it isn't proper to even be in love any more, since all this scandal has been stirred up in the film colony. Most of the girls are behaving like cloistered nuns, these days.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 16, 1922 Louis Joseph Vance MILWAUKEE JOURNAL During my brief career as a motion picture producer in Los Angeles in 1915 I heard often and again girls whose dress and manner indicated that they had been brought up in homes of refinement, offer themselves more or less brazenly to the casting director in return for a day's work as an extra woman, at a wage of $3 or $5 or it might be $7.50--not for the money involved always, though heaven knew many of them needed money, but for the chance they foresaw of catching the eye of the director by some manifestation of good camera value and being thereby started on the way up to the eminences. It isn't in human nature to resist such temptations. Neither is it done. Bear in mind that the invitation to irregular moral relations in this last related instance didn't come from old hands in the picture business, but from inexperienced beginners, many of them young women drawn from that very class which holds up its hands in holy horror of the goings-on of picture folk in Hollywood.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 18, 1922 HOLLYWOOD CITIZEN "I think," said Rob Wagner, chairman of the Writer's Club committee on the subject of motion picture and Hollywood publicity, "that much of the misconception that arises about Hollywood is due to the continued use of the word 'colony'. People in the east look upon us here as a remote, detached 'colony', probably with a fence around it, making our own morals and dominated by motion picture people who simply wallow in debauchery. "In view of these facts, I ask that in future the word 'colony' in connection with the motion picture industry in Hollywood be banned." Two other words were asked to be placed on the taboo list as well: "Movie" and "lot" in connection with the studios here. [3]

***************************************************************************** Editorial Contemplations

February 10, 1922 TULSA TRIBUNE Doctors hurry, bankers worry, another movie murder threatens to tear down the assets of another line of movie reels. At twice the salary of the President of the United States the movie producers hire Will Hays out of the President's cabinet to lend a touch of respectability to a gigantic business that has lost its place of popular respect because it has deported itself in defiance of public decency. Will Hays has announced that he is going to Hollywood to personally investigate conditions there. He has served notice sufficiently in advance to find things remarkably good and pleasing there by the time of his advent. Not unlike the old-fashioned Tulsa police raids, a tip in time will save many.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 9, 1922 KANSAS CITY STAR Tricky Ways of the Hollywood Clues The difficulty that confronts the Hollywood police seems to be a superfluity of clues. If they had only one they might know what to do. Now, there's the handkerchief picked up at the scene of the crime, an initialed handkerchief, too. A beautiful clue, a favorite always. But the police no sooner start work on the handkerchief than a feminine garment shows up, pink, so we read, and marked with still other initials. This is confusing. Nor is that all; letters are found, and while the police are reading the letters the handkerchief disappears. Then while they are trying to find where the handkerchief disappeared to, the letters disappear. It is announced the letters have been returned to the writers of them, but the writers say it's no such thing, and again the police head swims. The thing threatens to become complicated. It's no longer a question of finding who fired the shot, not that merely; but who took the handkerchief and where did the letters go. In a way, it's a little unfair to the police. They doubtless are competent and prepared to work on a murder case, but no police anywhere is qualified to reveal the trick in professional sleight of hand. It's not their line. If they pick up a handkerchief, mark it Exhibit A and put it in the safe, that's their job done. They can't be expected to sit there and watch it-
-the murderer might get away. The letters, too; now we see them and now we don't. Pouf--they're gone. What is to do? If we were the police we'd shrug. The pink garment, we hope, is still there. It may turn out to be unimportant, but the authorities ought to hang on to something. With things disappearing out the window the way they do in that town, and everybody saying, honest, and on their honor, they don't know anything about it, evidence becomes of real value. Essential, maybe. Especially where there's so much one day and so little the next. That's why it seems one good reliable clue, one clue that would stay fixed overnight is what the police seem to need, rather than so many handkerchief, pink garment and letter clues that have no stability. No character, so to speak. What you might call Hollywood, or movie clues. Maybe a reliable or trustworthy clue is too much to expect in connection with a Hollywood murder, but even so the police have rights in Hollywood as well as the movies. If anybody tries to take that pink thing away, after all that's happened to the other clues, the police would be justified in demanding of such a person, or persons, what they want it for. That's the inflexible position we'd take if we were the Hollywood police--considering all the circumstances, that is, and not meaning to be harsh.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 26, 1922 NEW YORK TIMES Thoughts on Hollywood There is no need to accept the stories of "drug rings," "weird love cults," and other short words fitting easily into headlines which have come from Los Angeles since the last homicide in Hollywood. Perhaps they are true; probably not. Most assertions on any subject are untrue--especially in California, where everything is large, including the imagination of the inhabitants. If it is true that most residents of Hollywood make love carelessly, extensively, and without discrimination, it is because most of them know no other way to kill time. The same excuse could hardly be offered for similar offenders elsewhere. The pleasures of the senses are popular in Hollywood because most of the residents know no other pleasures--not, as elsewhere, because the pleasures of the intellect have been tried and found wanting. Hollywood's residents are certainly no worse than would be any similar number of attractive, uneducated young people who had suddenly come into great wealth and a peculiarly heady sort of fame. Most of us, in their situation, would do as they do; since we are not in their situation, but one materially far less prosperous, we make the best of our comparative moral grandeur. Because the temptations of wealth and luxury have never assailed us we fall on those who have succumbed. We may have done as badly with less excuse, but we haven't been caught; and if we were caught, we should never gain the unhappy notoriety of the rich and famous. So what we take out on Hollywood is our resentment, not at its wickedness, but at its wealth. We go forth joyfully to indulge in the national, perhaps the universally human sport, of kicking a man who is down. On vague, confusing and perhaps wholly unfounded suspicion we are willing to lynch a town and an industry en masse; and, as in most lynching mobs, righteous wrath is perhaps less potent than a sort of envy.

The ability to compound the details of a thriller does not imply the ability to analyze the compound of details left behind by a real assassin. Even the redoubtable Conan Doyle did not retire from fiction to Scotland Yard; he retired to spiritualism.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 22, 1922 BUFFALO NEWS The Movie Mind Take the word of Thompson Buchanan, movie playwright, all this pother over a murder and a scandal or two or three in Hollywood is but part of a clever plot. Wall Street has done it. He will not go so far as to say that the moneyed villains of Wall Street procured the murder of William Desmond Taylor. But Wall Street is behind the campaign to "blacken the names" of the producers and the actors. It was Wall Street that hired agitators to shout for a censorship. Wall Street plans to "ruin the industry and then buy in the wreck". Wall Street's ulterior purpose--but of course you have fathomed it already--is "to control public opinion, to make sure nothing antagonistic to its interest is uttered to the public." One of the dreariest of indoor pastimes is to dissect an asinine argument. The image of a malevolent, closely knit organization controlling the nation's wealth and plotting, plotting, plotting, persists in only a few quaint minds such as Thompson Buchanan's. It is equally obvious, is it not, that any group of investors who desired to buy movie companies could do so without any overwhelming difficulty? We suspect that there is not a financier of consequence in New York who has not been implored at one time or another to back or help this movie concern or that. The greatest companies are avowedly owned by bankers and their stocks are quoted daily on the open exchanges. And isn't it just like the want-wits of Wall Street to set out deliberately to destroy utterly the value of a million dollars' worth of films of some star who is working for them, or for their debtors? Why, then, all the space Mr. Buchanan got yesterday? Because Mr. Buchanan's mental processes so perfectly reveal what ails a great part of the movie industry. Read him and you understand all. You comprehend at last that the master minds of the movies are not osseous, as perhaps you had supposed, bus viscous, melting easily to a thin fluid when slightly heated.

A suspicion may lurk that life in the mountain regions of North Carolina is too tame, but we should think that after recent Los Angeles developments, a little tameness is what the moving picture world is in need of. The staged banquet and jazz party is going out of popular favor, but if some of that sort must yet be produced, the North Carolina mountaineer can supply a few bottles of the labeled "in bond" that would have a more riotous effect than anything they have been able to get out in California. So, they need not hold back on that score.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 10, 1922 HELENA INDEPENDENT Worries Los Angeles It is not surprising that every obstacle possible seems to be thrown in the way of the officers seeking a solution of the movie murder mystery at Hollywood. The salacious Arbuckle case and several other cases of less prominence, capped by the Taylor murder, has started an agitation in New York, where most of the big producers live, to have the California studios scrapped and the movie folk moved to Gotham, which doesn't mind a murder or a smelly orgy every day. Naturally, the Californians don't like the idea of one of the biggest industries in Los Angeles being moved away. Therefore, the big moving picture companies, which are reported to be exercising powerful influence to soft- pedal the scandal, are probably receiving much encouragement from the commercial interests of the city. To complicate the situation, Will Hays, who is soon to be the directing head of five of the largest moving picture producing agencies, is reported to have said that he will move Hollywood from California and set up the colony in New York. Hays is too much of a politician to make such a break, in our opinion. Even if he thought the idea a good one, he would never publicly advocate it, for if the plan is carried out, California would not go Republican or Democratic either in 1924. It would go crazy.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 8, 1922 Gil Cowan GLENDALE NEWS Los Angeles Mayor George E. Cryer in this morning's papers tried to drag Los Angeles out of the mud--but it rained. It seems that the Mayor thinks the movie colony is all right. He would have people believe that it isn't as bad as painted--but they paint too much in the movies. Without discussing the Taylor murder mystery, but bearing down on the conditions in Hollywood, or Califilmland in general, it must be said that there are a half dozen great big contributing causes for the bad repute which is to be eliminated by the industry. First--Discharge all of the low-brow hangers on, cousins of the director, friends of the star, or other persons who do not merit the positions they hold. This likely would reduce production costs 50 per cent. Second--Install managers who will not be subject to the petty politics of the studio and have absolute power over directors, stars and property. Many a dollar has been lost because of some crazy idea on the part of a director. Third--Instruct the publicity department to eliminate all salacious sayings in connection with problem plays; censor any sensuous "stills" and otherwise attract patronage on the merit of the complete film alone. Fourth--The State of California should have a law enabling it to deport undesirable citizens. Thousands of girls fling themselves upon the industry for support. Naturally, they are "cheap." There should be some way of sending them back to Kokomo and Kalamazoo. Fifth--But, but most important of all, there should be white men--real red blooded Americans owning and controlling the industry. A refined, educated person has no desire to enter the employ of the unscrupulous and money-mad who were brought up in the perverting influence of downtown New York, or some other salacious center. [4] Hollywood is pure, sweet, simple, wonderful--compared with the eastern environment picture people are forced into. If the calcium light must play on a dead director why not turn it toward some of the producers who are still alive and countenancing unsavory things about their studios?
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 15, 1922 Hereward Carrington ALBANY NEWS Our personality is built-up largely by what we SEE. Our eyesight is our greatest educator. So true is this that it has been calculated that not more than six per cent of those born blind actually attain sufficient character and mentality to become self-supporting! The "movies" are today a constant series of visual suggestions. And we are all creatures of suggestion! We are built-up largely by what we hear, feel and see. Those who have seen movies in the making know that the directors dominate the entire case, men and women alike. And it is a psychological fact that it would be easy for a strong director to carry this domination beyond the studio, for good or for evil. Every actor or actress is better or worse for the role he depicts. None can live two roles forever, even on the stage and off, and escape having them co-mingle, any more any more than Dr. Jekyl could escape from Mr. Hyde. Usually the evil overwhelms the good. There are two distinct kinds of pictures. Those that represent life as it is,--extol courage, honor, sincerity and the higher qualities of man's nature. These are undoubtedly beneficial, and are a source of great good to the community, and to those who make them. The other kind of pictures, appealing to mawkish sentimentality, extolling the pettier emotions of jealousy, vanity, the worship of brute force and the frequent misinterpretation of the true values of life, are a source of great mischief and lead to an entirely warped conception of society as a whole. This sort of picture sacrifices fundamental truths in order to appeal to false sentimentality. For instance, a handsome crook is shrouded in a cloak of romance. He is captioned "a gentleman crook," whose finer instincts remain unstained, although he transgresses every law. And those who uphold the law, are either held up to ridicule or an odious light. What is this but a very subtle justification of crime? The natural effect of this upon young and untrained minds is to confuse actual vice and crime with heroic glamour. The undoubted result of this can be no more than that many are led by these suggestions and false conceptions to a life of instinctive defiance to the law, or even into the commission of actual crime. The recent murder of William Taylor, with its sordid horror and morbid revelations, would doubtless serve as an excellent "super-release!" The romantic scenario writer probably would go as far as to concoct some theatrical justification for this crime, and strive to weave a halo of romance about the perpetrator, even to the extent of marrying him to the heroine! That's the psychology of "movie madness."

PAUL DISPATCH) Who killed William Desmond Taylor is a mystery as absorbing as anything Sherlock Holmes ever solved. Millions of people are more curious to know the answer to this riddle than about any of the great questions of the day. Some are interested in the rise and fall of stocks and bonds, the price of wheat, the Genoa conference, the next big fight or baseball dope, but more are watching developments at Los Angeles than are attracted by any of those other things. Every little bit of information so far deepens the mystery and whets the appetite for more. The "suspects" soon will be numerous enough to make a parade, eight abreast, which will be 10 minutes in passing "a given point."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 3, 1922 RICHMOND NEWS LEADER Spoiled Idols The murder of William Desmond Taylor, movie director, comes so quickly on the heels of the Arbuckle case that, no matter who the slayer may prove to be, the country will be confirmed in its conviction that the movie colony at Hollywood has had its head turned by adulation. It is not a new thing. One of the oldest and most curious chapters in human psychology tells how the successive popular idols of centuries have been "spoiled" until they lost their perspective. When Greek youths won fame in the Olympic games, no doubt there were successful gamblers who entertained them lavishly and silly women who went "crazy" about them. In Latin literature, there are many echoes of the applause given gladiators. If the truth were discoverable, it probably would be found that Sir Launcelot was as conceited as a Derby jockey of today, and that Sir Galahad spent as much time in front of a mirror as on his knees. A few centuries more and the "spoiled class" consisted of the mercenary chieftain, the condottiere. One need only read Venetian history to see how insufferable these popular idols became. The greatest condottiere of them all solemnly warned the Italian people never to give another man such favor as they heaped upon him: It was dangerous to the state. So the list might be followed to our own day. Contemporary America differs from other countries in earlier ages only in that, so far as one can see, they spoiled only one class, whereas America spoils a hundred. Whoever has his name often in the newspapers and frequently appears before the public is in danger of infection from the germ of self-importance. Escape from ruin may be possible. A cure is not.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 18, 1922 SAVANNAH NEWS Somebody with a bright idea wants to "probe" the moving picture industry. But what does somebody want to find out? The government is not going to investigate unless there is a probability that a law is being broken by the industry, and so far while there may be a lot of individuals in the movies breaking laws, what is there in the recent cases of Arbuckle and Taylor for the United States to look into? Will actors and actresses be all of them asked if they smoke cigarettes and chew gum and dance? Will they be asked if they take a little drink now and then when they think the brand is safe? Will they all be asked if they have led strictly moral lives? Will they be made to tell the truth about their salaries?
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 10, 1922 KANSAS CITY STAR The Outrage on Movie Privacy The privileged class of Hollywood seems inclined to resent public interest in what that class regards as essentially a private murder. It is a view, of course, for which something may be said. Movie actors and actresses are entitled to preserve decently the privacies of family life as much as anybody. They are, in a sense, a single great family, as is shown by the fact that they leave their wardrobes around indiscriminately at each other's houses. Very well, then, if they are entitled to family privacy, is the public concerned in one of their own exclusive murders? It was, as all accounts show, conducted with entire propriety. It wasn't flaunted in the public's face nor committed in such a manner as to constitute a breach of the public peace. Except technically, of course. But what is meant is, that it was done quietly--almost with reserve. Indeed, the delicacy observed by the guilty person, the modesty and shrinking, ought to go far to disprove the charge so often made that the manners of moviedom are loud and vulgar. As murders go, this was a refined one. There was no public brawling, no public display of bad taste, no shocking public violence. It was a parlor murder, done in a private residence and apparently at a respectable hour. Moreover it was done upon a person of irreproachable public manners, of pleasing, even courtly, address--a gentleman if clothes ever made one. All the movie ladies said so, and even maintained it in strong terms, so we read, which again goes to show it. Thus it is established it was a private murder, a family murder, a gentlemanly perhaps even ladylike murder. And exclusive, it goes without saying. Such is the view held by moviedom, which inquires with raised and penciled eyebrows where the public gets in. Well, the public does seem a little abashed. It apparently had no idea when it first intruded what a private little affair it was. It had no idea it was going to run into pink initialed nightwear, letters hidden in the toe of a riding boot and other little domestic kickshaws of a light housekeeping character of similar nature. It was like blundering into a bathroom when it was in use. Unconventional in its own family circle moviedom may be, but the public, being perhaps a trifle narrow--provincial even--couldn't help but feel some embarrassment. To that extent, at least, moviedom does occupy the stronger position. It was the intruded upon, not the intruder. And its feelings, through strong, are not feelings of embarrassment. Its feeling seems to be that when the public looks at a movie pink nightie it ought first to pay at the box office. In a word, the movies resent their industry being commercialized to gratify public curiosity. It's being lowered, cheapened, vulgarized by an intrusive and prying spirit that respects neither privacy nor decency. This pink garment and these letters-- this murder even--were not for release. Still, the thing has gone so far now movie privacy probably will not be able to regain its countenance just yet. The public and the police are in, intrusively or not, and probably will insist on looking around a bit. The murder, private or not, is now public and the public will have its gossip. It may be demoralizing to a privileged profession--the talk, that is--but mystery murders are one of the public's weaknesses. Maybe the film industry will admit that; and if moviedom should happen to have any weakness of its own, it will understand how the public feels and try to put up with the annoyance.

Taylor, murdered motion-picture director, was held prisoner for nearly twelve hours in the office of the Los Angeles Examiner, and that Examiner reporters late at night took Peavey to the tomb of Taylor, where they attempted to bully and terrorize him by confronting him with a "ghost," were made last night by Dist.-Atty. Woolwine, who characterized the Examiner's actions as "presumptuous, dangerous and dastardly." The energetic denunciation of Examiner tactics by Mr. Woolwine followed a long conference between the District Attorney and William F. Eldridge, managing editor of the Examiner, who went to Mr. Woolwine's office on the eleventh floor of the Hall of Records. Mr. Eldridge was preceded in the District Attorney's office by Peavey, who related in detail the asserted offenses of the Examiner's representatives. Twelve typewritten pages comprised Peavey's statement to the District Attorney. He said that two men came to his room before noon last Sunday and asked him to come out. "I am not doing any talking to newspaper reporters"--Peavey said he informed the pair. One of the men, he said, replied: "Newspaper reporters? We are not newspaper reporters; we are officers from New York and we have authority to come down here and get you and have you go over your statements, and we want you to go down to the Examiner office and answer one question." Peavey said that he asked them to tell him what question he was to be asked, but that they said they did not know, adding, he said, "there's $1000 in it for you." Instead of taking him direct to the Examiner office, however, he said, one of the men announced, "It is a beautiful day and we will drive around for awhile." He says he got into an automobile with the men and was driven through Hollywood and through the cemetery where Mr. Taylor's body lies. Returning, he says, the automobile picked up another man at the Alexandria and then proceeded to the Examiner office. Upon arriving there, according to Peavey, "we went in and a gentleman asked me what movie man it was in Hollywood that was paying me to keep my mouth shut, and I looked at him and said, 'Nobody has ever given me a penny for anything excepting this gentleman here, who gave me $10.' " This money, Peavey said, was handed to him during his automobile ride Sunday afternoon. Peavey told the District Attorney that he was kept waiting for some time in the Examiner office and that he asked to be permitted to get something to eat, whereupon, he stated, one of the men said, "No, we will send out and buy you some." He described the supper brought into the Examiner for him and said that after further questioning he was taken to Hollywood by the three Examiner reporters. He said the Examiner men referred several times to a spiritualist who would, according to his story of their assertions, cause him to talk with Mr. Taylor's spirit. His remarkable story of the appearance of the Examiner's "ghost" and the fiasco that ensued is taken from the transcript of his testimony on file in Mr. Woolwine's office. "They drove into the cemetery and said, 'Gee; goodness! it makes me nervous to drive into a cemetery at night. How do you feel, Henry?' I replied, 'It doesn't bother me.' They drove up to the vault where Mr. Taylor was lying. They said, 'Turn quick.' They turned the car and all the lights went out to make it dark. "I got out of the car and walked over to the vault and just as I got there a man walked out from behind the vault with a white sheet over him and they said, 'Look! look! look! there is Taylor!'[1] "I stood and looked at him and he commenced to make some funny noises and dropped down and got me around the feet and commenced groaning. They kept trying to make me run, and I wouldn't run, and said: " 'What in the hell are you guys trying to make out of me anyway, a fool?' " Peavey related that a further attempt to intimidate him was made by the Examiner last night, but that he paid no attention to his asserted tormentors. Mr. Woolwine's statement denouncing the Examiner follows: "Henry Peavey, the negro servant of William D. Taylor, deceased, who has shown a very deep and genuine grief over the murder of Mr. Taylor, and who has at all times given the authorities every assistance in his power in their effort to unravel the mystery of the murder, and who has held himself ready to respond to repeated calls by the officers for such information as he could give, was taken from his room by a pair of conscienceless blackguards who represented themselves to be officers of the law, and held a prisoner from noon until about midnight on last Sunday. During this imprisonment, he was subjected to the most outrageous treatment. He was held for hours in the office of the Los Angeles Examiner, not even being permitted to leave the premises to get necessary food when he became hungry. "To add to the unspeakable injustice of this high-handed procedure, he was conveyed to the cemetery by night by these two scoundrels, who first took him from his room, and another rascal who joined them, was taken to the tomb of his former employer and every effort made to bully and terrorize him. "It should be remembered that this man, Peavey, had been subjected to the most searching examination, not only by the District Attorney's office, but by the skilled officers of the Los Angeles Police Department of many years' experience in the detection of crime. He has at all times shown the utmost anxiety and eagerness in his effort to render to the duly constituted authorities every assistance possible. Is is regrettable that the District Attorney has no jurisdiction over the offense committed by these miscreants for the false imprisonment of this witness. I have not been able as yet to ascertain their names, but if I knew them, and had such jurisdiction, they would be in jail tonight. "It seems that this witness's only offense is that he is a simple-minded colored man, who has little knowledge of his real rights as an American citizen and can neither read nor write. This presumptuous, dangerous and dastardly interference by a newspaper with the orderly course of procedure by the duly constituted authorities, is calculated to and does so terrorize good and well-meaning people that they, for their own protection, keep secret important facts that might lead to the discovery to the perpetrators of foul crimes. Such acts are a positive menace to the people at large. "I feel it my duty as District Attorney of Los Angeles County, to expose such vile, cowardly and unlawful practices, for the perpetrators of which every decent citizen should feel a most supreme and utter contempt."

Odds & Ends

February 18, 1922 MIAMI HERALD We have been feeling a little guilty recently ever since we said that the movies were not true to life. We really didn't expect that our words would have such an immediate effect on Hollywood, Cal., that they would feel it necessary to make their lives true to movies.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 17, 1922 H. I. Phillips PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER On the Hollywood Grill Prosecutor: Now go on and tell us all about it. Movie Actress: There really is nothing much to tell. I had simply dropped in to borrow a copy of the Fireman's Weekly Herald. We were both very literary. We talked a short time, and then I got into my sedan and went home. Somehow I felt uneasy and I went back to the bungalow. As I entered it I saw Bartholomew in a heap on the floor. An overturned piano rested on his chest and there was a bookcase across his neck. Prosecutor: Whadja do then? Movie Actress: Nothing. It didn't strike me as suspicious at first. Bartholomew was often that way when I called! Prosecutor: Often that way? Movie Actress: Well, I mean he was often in a heap on the floor, although I don't recall that he ever had the furniture scattered over him before. So, not thinking anything of it, I sat down on the floor and tried to talk to him. He didn't answer. Then I shook him, and when he didn't respond I began to think something was wrong. Prosecutor: You finally became suspicious? Movie Actress: Yeah. I think it was the way the furniture was arranged over him. Suddenly the thought flashed over me that he had been a victim of violence! Prosecutor: Then whadja do? Movie Actress: I rushed out on to the front porch and cried for help. Prosecutor: Did anybody answer? Movie Actress: Why, er, it was most peculiar; there were six other bungalows in the block and there was a movie actress on the front porch of each one yelling for help, too. I shouted, "Oh, girls, my director has been murdered!" Prosecutor: What'd they say? Movie Actress: They all yelled back, "So has mine!" Prosecutor: Then whadja do? Movie Actress: We all got together, and I found all the girls had had exactly the same experience I had. Prosecutor: Didn't that strike you as unusual? Movie Actress: Well, it was the first time we'd ever had six crimes in the same block on the same night. Prosecutor: Did you see anybody else in the neighborhood? Movie Actress: I saw a stout man in a cap and muffler looking around the lawn of a hotel across the street. Prosecutor: What was he doing? Movie Actress: At first I thought he might have been connected with the slayings, but I later found he was a prominent screen comedian and knew nothing about them. Prosecutor: What was he looking around the lawn for? Movie Actress: It seems he had been giving a little dinner party in the hotel and had thrown a young lady guest out of the window in a playful mood. He was trying to find her when I saw him. Prosecutor: I have been told by my detectives that a large motor truck was in the vicinity immediately after the shootings. Did you see it? Movie Actress: Oh, yes, indeedy. Prosecutor: What was it doing there? Movie Actress: Must I tell? Prosecutor: Yes, it may have an important bearing on the case. Movie Actress: Well, we girls sent for it to come and cart our letters away. (Curtain as the prosecutor collapses.)

Yes, we've seen "Tillie"--featuring Mary Miles Minter--and it was sickening, entering the theater to see how many people were NOT there to witness the photoplay but to gape at Mary with morbid eyes, eager to discover in the lovely face that had charmed them so many times, signs of dissoluteness.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 17, 1922 VARIETY The Taylor murder is proving costly to practically all coast production companies at this time. Star, director and cameraman have been busily engaged in the discussion of the case each morning at a time they are scheduled to "shoot." It is safe to say an hour or two were wasted daily last week on all of the bigger lots as the result of the "post mortem" the Los Angeles dailies were holding over the character of the slain man.

The children told the patrolman, "We are going to Hollywood, where all the rich people live."

Dr. Tridon, interviewed at his home today on aspects of the Taylor slaying, explained: "The adrenal gland, a small gland located above the kidneys, is the physical center of the soul-differences between blondes and brunettes. In blondes this gland has a large center and a thin covering or cortex. The center of the gland makes excretions as a result of fear, and the covering makes an excretion of anger. The blonde has more fear and less anger than the brunette. It is a simple matter of physical fact. "In the case of a man who is shot in the back, evidently from ambush or by an unseen assailant, it is almost dead certain that the woman who did it, if it was a woman, had blonde hair and a fair complexion. A brunette, being more violent in temperament, would have faced the man she killed in order to have the violent pleasure of letting him know she was doing it. "This does not mean that blondes are less emotional than brunettes. There is no law, physical or psychological, to regulate the emotions. I mean only that blondes are less violent than brunettes. "The dark peoples of the earth, moved by tremendous angers and passions, are the people who use knives and like to get a close quarters with their victims when they go out to kill. "If a brunette had committed the Taylor murder she might have used a stiletto, or knife of some kind. At any rate, she would have faced him and shot while he realized what she was doing. The brunette demands actual contact with the object of her love or hate."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 26, 1922 Louella Parsons NEW YORK TELEGRAPH Social Requirements If one is invited to dine or to luncheon, or to tea outside the industry one is expected to have at least one original idea on who murdered Taylor. At first it was rather a shock to have someone say: "Oh come, you know all the inside dope, tell me." Not having had any previous experience with unraveling murder mysteries and not being a graduate of a Sherlock Holmes school it was something of a blow to be prepared to given an explanation of who killed the most talked of man in the country. To our earnest, "Really I did not know Mr. Taylor. I have no idea who could have killed him," we have been met with suspicious looks and a manner as if we were concealing some of the inside facts. But every one else in the motion picture industry has had the same experience. To be connected with motion pictures in any way is enough to make the layman believe one should know more than State's Attorney Woolwine and the men who are unraveling this murder mystery.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * June 10, 1922 Karl Kitchen LITERARY DIGEST (reprinted from NEW YORK WORLD) Just as an oil-well may be described as a hole in the ground owned by a liar, Hollywood may be described as a collection of bungalows and motion- picture studios written about by liars. It is an actual fact that more lies have been written about this dreary, desolate suburb of Los Angeles than any other part of California. Hollywood is in no sense a city. It has no local government, no art galleries, no museums, no institutions of learning aside from primary schools and kindergartens--nothing that makes the slightest pretense to culture-- civic or otherwise. Its only restaurants are cafeterias--self-serve tooth and jaw gymnasiums where it is as fashionable to use a toothpick in public as it is to leave the spoon in one's cup. It doesn't boast of a single theater except the cheapest movie playhouses. There are no evidences of any life--wicked or of the night variety-- anywhere within its precincts. If in the daytime more than two people walk abreast on Hollywood or Sunset Boulevards--broad avenues that lead nowhere-- the inhabitants mistake them for a parade. In fact, no inmate of this quiet suburb leaves his home after sundown except, perhaps, to buy an evening paper. My own theory is that William Desmond Taylor committed suicide rather than remain in Hollywood another fortnight.

-that little Miss ------ ------ is the sort of a girl she should be." "No," I replied frankly, "she is not. Were Miss ------ ------ an ordinary girl a good sound spanking would be of vast benefit to her and to the motion picture industry as a whole." "It is so easy--" there was a sneer in his tone. "--then why isn't it done?" "I will tell you why. In the days before motion pictures came into vogue, Mama ------ ------ , a blue-nosed Yankee [sic] woman, was a stock actress of mediocre ability and with a sniveling brat on her hands. She never knew whether her next week's booking would be in vaudeville or the poorhouse. Can you imagine Mama ------ ------'s feelings when this same brat jumped into public popularity and a large salary because of a winsomeness which appealed to motion picture audiences!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 21, 1922 H. I. Phillips NEW YORK GLOBE Analyzing a Hollywood Clue A new mystery woman has been brought into the investigation of William Desmond Taylor's murder. A garage man has told how a young woman, bareheaded and in evening gown, appeared to be fleeing from Los Angeles the night of the murder. "She stopped at a garage in Ventura, Cal., at 3 A.M. and ordered all the gasoline and oil her car would hold," says the dispatch. "She had driven up at a terrific speed, her hair was blown awry, her face was pale and drawn, and she bit nervously at her gloves. She gave a bill in payment, and did not wait for change." Maybe she shot Taylor, but her actions, according to the above account, were only those of a woman whose husband had become too helpless to drive, and who was doing her best to get him and the car home before sunrise. Probably, had the garage man looked, he would have seen him asleep on the floor of the car muttering: "Who shays I'm too drunk t' drive ish car? All right, then, you drive ish!"
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * March 12, 1922 BOSTON GLOBE George Ade, who recently spent several weeks in Hollywood, tells an amusing story about the scramble of some of the film stars to appear "respectable" following the sensational stories recently coming out of Hollywood. According to Ade it got to be quite the fashion for youthful film stars to be photographed with their mothers in order to show how well they were protected. "And do you know," says Ade, "some of the gelatine stars spent two or three weeks finding where their mothers lived so that they could wire them to come to Hollywood to have their pictures taken."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 13, 1922 Walter Anthony SAN FRANCISCO BULLETIN We wondered why a guard was placed around the home of Mary Miles Minter, following the publication of her passionate "I love you, I love you" letter to Taylor. When Miss Minter broke into print in an interview the reason was clear. She, or some one wiser than she, surrounded her with guards to prevent her from talking for publication. Of the man who deserted his wife and baby and whose whole career is a mystery and a camouflage, Mary said: "I don't believe he ever had a wife. He never told me he had, and our acquaintance was such that I'm sure he wouldn't deceive me. He could only be compared with God, he was so good." Mary doesn't need a guard, she needs a gag.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 8, 1922 Roy Moulton NEW YORK MAIL Twinkle, Little Movie Star, How I Wonder Where You Are! The motto of the fillum colony seems to be "Fillum up again." But that doesn't lead us any closer to the solution of the crime. We are now getting our own news from Hollywood and in the rush of getting out an afternoon paper we are obliged to present it in a sort of disjointed way, mingling the strictly editorial utterances with the news items. That such a thing could happen in the motion picture colony is shocking and unexpected. To begin with, according to my reports from the scene, everybody is agreed that the victim was not fond of any woman, didn't associate with them and was practically a hermit. Never a breath, you understand-- FLASH: Quantities of silk lingerie and negligee found in bureau drawers of bungalow. Silk nighties neatly folded, some with hairpins in them. TO EDITORS--ADD FLASH--Taylor did not wear silk nighties or hairpins. The plot thickens. Miss Mazie Tabasco, prominent and beautiful screen star, told the police today that she never knew Taylor, never saw him and that he did not tell her he was going to beat up his valet. Miss Tabasco last appeared in 1909 in "The Tribulations of Tillie." She maintained under close questioning that she never heard of Taylor. Nobody in the film colony ever heard of her. So it looks like a draw. Bill Taylor was a man's man. Everybody in the movie colony knew that. He associated with men who did embroidery and knitting and point lace. All the love letters in the bungalow were tied with blue baby ribbon. ADD MAZIE TABASCO: Miss Tabasco wore a charming mink coat and rolled stockings when questioned by the police. She was almost overcome by emotion but was not too weak to be photographed. Miss Juniper Berry, a beautiful screen star, was bewitchingly dressed as she alighted from her motor in front of police headquarters this morning, where she went to volunteer what information she didn't have concerning the crime. She wore a saucy turban with red cherries, a mauve sport coat. She didn't know a thing about the crime, but the photographers got some excellent pictures. Miss Berry is one of the most prominent unknown screen actresses in the country. She is looking for a job. FLASH: The gun was a .38-caliber. Important. ADD FLASH: Jealousy was the cause. A well-known actor was in love with a beautiful actress who had an ice cream soda with Taylor three years ago, and he swore vengeance. He will be arrested before night, but we don't know what night. FLASH: It has been definitely proven that jealousy was not the cause. The actress mentioned is Miss Hyacinth De Vere. She never met Taylor, and she says it was not an ice cream soda she had with him that day anyhow, but a nut sundae. IMPORTANT: Miss June Bugg, the beautiful film favorite, has hastened here to deny a statement that has never been made to the effect that she was in the bungalow at the time of the murder. She was in Kansas City that night. She indignantly denies that she was engaged to Taylor. Nobody ever said she was, and the incident has been dropped. "I loved him with all my heart and soul," sobbed Miss Lutie Bibbins, the beautiful film star, after she had fought her way into police headquarters to give her version of the affair. "I loved him, but there was nothing sentimental about it. We were just good pals." Miss Bibbins wore attractive furs and a Paris suit, also galoshes with buttons not buttoned. She carried a walking stick with gold head incrusted with diamonds. FLASH: Miss Ida Frothingham, the well-known and beautiful screen star, informed the police today that Miss Bibbins had never seen Taylor in her life. "I am the one who gave him the $1,800 ebony cigarette holder," said Miss Frothingham. "He was my best friend and I am all busted up. If you have got to get my picture don't get a profile. I am simply overwhelmed." Others who denied to the police today that they were engaged to Taylor were Misses Ivy Stump, Hazel Wood, Rose Bush, Celludid St. Claire, Amethyst Binks, Geraldine Gimme, Minnie Maggie Mudge, Tapioca Todd and Lucille Luscious. One hundred and thirty-seven beautiful film stars denied themselves to callers today. The plot thickens. Miss Anastasia Hash, prominent and beautiful film star, volunteered some important evidence to the police today. Miss Hash's story was as follows, taken from stenographic notes: "I passed right by the bungalow three evenings before the crime and I didn't see a thing. I got this sable coat in Paris. I never met Mr. Taylor. My next picture will be produced by the Punkart people. I have never been in love." Miss Oleomargarine Pipp, the beautiful film star, told the police today: "I had lunch with Mr. Taylor in 1919 in Los Angeles. I didn't notice anything wrong with him then. I have not seen him since." FLASH--IMPORTANT: The bungalow was built of wood. FLASH: New and important witness sought. He is a man high up in the screen profession--very high indeed. He does airplane stunts. Evidence is very strong against him as the possible murderer, as he was in New York at the time of the shooting. Miss Gardenia Geranium Julap, the well-known and beautiful screen star, is hastening to Hollywood from Alaska to be interviewed. She was there on location at the time of the crime and never heard of Taylor before. She is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The police believe they have rounded up nearly everybody who doesn't know anything about the crime and who never knew Taylor. Was it jealousy? Was it business rivalry? Did some woman hire an assassin to fire the bullet? Was it a holdup? One feature of the thing has baffled the police from the start. There doesn't seem to be any woman mixed up in it. And then again, it has come to a pretty pass when the movie colony cannot pull off a murder or two without the police getting all steamed up over it. Please pass the smelling salts.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 13, 1922 Herb Westen SAN FRANCISCO CALL-POST (Los Angeles)--Out of a population of 567,000 today in this city there are 575,996 amateur and professional detectives seeking the murderer of Taylor. Out of the remaining four two are deaf, dumb and blind and do not read the newspapers; one left town this morning and the fourth is--the slayer himself. The sleuthing fever is at a high heat and book stores report a phenomenal run on Sherlock Holmes, Craig Kennedy and the lurid Nick Carter. With the incentive of two $1000 rewards, one offered by a local newspaper and the other by the Screen Writers' Guild, everyone is suspicious of everyone else and the chief of police is considering ordering everyone but the slayer to wear a badge.

Confessions, Confessions

February 16, 1922 NEW YORK HERALD (Los Angeles)--No end of letters from cranks are pouring into the investigative offices. Police Captain Adams says it beats anything in his nineteen years' experience. He has time to read only a few of them. One writes from Oregon that he did it, and adds, "I am leaving Portland tonight, but whether north, south, east or west I don't say. Come and find me." All these letters are being studied on the chance that one of them might yield pay dirt, but thus far they have proved merely vexations and time wasting.

This means that there are at least 300 weak-minded individuals in the country. One can hardly think of a feebler brain than the one that spends time and trouble to pretend the conception of a crime it knows nothing of except through the papers. But, after all, this is nothing to the exhibition of mental debility we would have if Taylor's murderer were behind the bars. The unsolved mystery of the crime has brought forward only one type of imbeciles. Another and far larger class would be produced by the capture of the criminal. Were his address known at some prominent jail thirty times 300 addlepates would proclaim themselves by sending him flowers, writing him scented notes full of silly slush, and trying to call on him in order to bring their morbid sentimentality into contact with his aura of iniquity. No, the Taylor mystery has by no means revealed all the whey wits in the country. The possibilities are not at all exhausted in the count of 300. And from that point of view we have really been lucky that the murderer has not been caught.

Would it not be well to take these persons at their word? Would it not be more than worth while for the detectives to run down these 300 confessed murderers, round them up at some central spot and hang the whole bunch?

***************************************************************************** The Public Speaks

February 10, 1922 NEW YORK NEWS The Inquiring Photographer THE QUESTION. Do you think a man or a woman murdered Taylor? THE ANSWERS. C. A. Cruise, cotton broker: "I think a woman murdered him. My experience and observations have shown me that a woman will do anything for revenge when she thinks she has been jilted. Some woman probably was insanely jealous." Mrs. E. W. Cunningham, housewife: "A man shot him. I base my opinion on the manner in which Taylor was murdered. It was so cleverly concealed that it must be the work of some man. A woman isn't so clever in such affairs." Arthur Schwartz, college student: "I think a man did the shooting, because a woman would never shoot a man in the back. She is too eager to see the expression of pain. And she feels that a jury will exonerate her anyway." Mrs. Tessie Saeger, housewife: "My intuition tells me that a woman fired the fatal shot. He had so many affairs that one of the women was bound to 'get him in the long run.' Once a woman gives her all, it isn't so easy to get rid of her. Dr. A. J. Lippman, dentist: "From the newspaper accounts it is impossible to form a definite opinion. Reporters now have a splendid opportunity to exercise their dramatic powers. But, of course, a woman was the cause."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * February 13, 1922 H. G. Meyer OMAHA BEE (letter to the editor) No one takes pleasure in accusing a dead man, who cannot defend himself before earthly accusers; nevertheless, lovers of decency fail to understand why anyone should want to defend William D. Taylor, the latest murder victim, and describe him as an "hitherto highly respected citizen." Enough has come to light to prove that if he enjoyed the respect of decent people, he was not worthy of it. Some may not be certain whether this is a case of a good man gone bad or a bad man found out. Usually character and habits are fully formed before middle age and it is not likely that this man Taylor was an exception. If he had always lived a clean, respectable life he would hardly have become the moral degenerate that his actions and mode of life, as now revealed, indicate. Since it has become known that in their social life many of the leading stars are flagrant violators of the laws of God and man, living in vice and debauchery, it is time that respectable people should turn their backs upon them and protect themselves from pollution. All citizens should obey the laws, including the 18th Amendment, and when they refuse to do so, let them be punished.

Mary Miles Minter is but a kid, despite her years before the public, and because of the unkindness of fate in throwing her into the way of a man more than twice her age and with much experience with women, because of a little gush note she is to be deprived of her livelihood. Instead of helping her regain her footing on the ladder of life, she is told to "Slide, Kelly, slide" strait to the devil; and if she doesn't go fast enough, they'll give her a boost down the chute. Then they'll go to church, singing "Hozanna," and praise God they are not as other men are, and for once they'll be right, for they are worse! Personally, I believe she is as straight and clean as the majority that walk the streets today.

As the father of two daughters and a son, it causes me no little concern to know that my children are made conversant with the affairs of the demi-monde[3] through reading the newspapers. It is all well and good to say that such things are part of life, and that children should not be kept in ignorance, but the fact remains that such recitals as frequently appear regarding the picture people work injury upon the plastic mind of the young man or woman.

Brashear LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL (letter to the editor) To what degree is the present abnormal prevalence of juvenile delinquency, together with the unusual "crime wave" in general, attributable directly and indirectly to the vicious scenario? There can be no reasonable doubt but what the movie screen, through its various forms of heroized criminality and its exhaltation of the salacious vampistic heroine is no small factor as an influence for crime and immorality. The revolting revelations of recent months of orgies indulged in by movie actors and actresses "high up" in the screen world would seem to indicate that these theatrical people are endeavoring to put in actual practice the logical significance of what they have indirectly preached through the screen. That they have descended personally to depravity is but a natural and inevitable consequence. For the purveyors of degradation naturally precede in infamy those whom they corrupt and are even the first to reach the limit of moral perdition. Theatrical screendom must be purged of the serpent's trail which, if not over it all, is yet over much of it; it must be taken wholly out of the hands of the sordid producer who would barter for gold the morals and decency of the people; it must cease to order films made in Sodom, Gomorrah or Hollywood.

***************************************************************************** Epilogue: August 1923 August 9, 1923 LOS ANGELES EXPRESS Mother Calls Mary M. Minter "If I should die before I wake, and it would mean your redemption, I would gladly go." With this prayer thought for her estranged daughter, Mary Miles Minter, famous motion picture actress, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby entered that dream world of unconsciousness that is next thing to death. Mrs. Shelby underwent a major operation at Good Samaritan Hospital Tuesday morning of this week for abcesses of the liver and dangerous intestinal trouble. Mary Miles Minter has talked a lot about "liberty" since she left her mother's home, and refused to return. Death may help her attain that desired liberty, for Mrs. Shelby's vitality is so low that it is a question whether she recovers. Letter after letter Mrs. Shelby has written to her "baby girl" imploring her to return. "The vultures who have taken possession of your baser self will drag you down to oblivion," wrote Mrs. Shelby to her little "Juliette." (Mary's name is Juliette O'Reilly.) This typecal mother lies today at death's door, and cares not whether she recovers. Life is not worth living if Mary is lost to her.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 9, 1923 LOS ANGELES HERALD "Has she come?" Many times today Mrs. Charlotte Shelby roused herself on her bed of pain and asked the doctors and nurses that question, but each time they were forced to shake their heads negatively in sorrow, for her daughter, Mary Miles Minter, the film star, has not come to see her in the hospital. Miss Minter is in the Pasadena. Lying at the point of death, with a presentiment that she will not recover, Mrs. Shelby has implored a reconciliation with her daughter, but her pleas have continued to fall on deaf ears.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 10, 1923 LOS ANGELES TIMES Mary to Sue Her Mother Mary Miles Minter is Irish. She admits it and she looked it yesterday afternoon. Her big blue eyes blazed with wrath, then filmed with tears as she told her side of the story of the dissension in her household which brought about the estrangement with her mother and sister to the breaking point. "They never would let me be a girl, to have a girl's pleasures, to do the things that other girls would do," she said. "I was never even allowed to have for myself the little pleasures shown in roles I played in pictures. I never had a doll, except that I held one in the pictures. I never had one all of my own. I never had a chance to play tag, or hide-and-go-seek or have a kiddiecar. I was always petted and pampered, tutored and touted, made to believe I was something I was not, do things I did not want to do, say things I did not mean. From morning till night I had money, money, money, talked and preached to me. I have earned lots of it, fairly hate it and have none of it. "Mother is sick, quite sick, but she is not critically ill and has never asked for me," said Mary. "I talked with her just last Saturday. She and my sister known just where I am, where I have been living, have my telephone number and could get me on a minute's notice. I have not disappeared, never ran away and never tried to. I just left to be alone, to get away from the constant argument, from the posing, the nagging, the humiliation of being told that I myself have never done anything, would not have anything, had it not been for the watchful eye of mother and Margaret, my older sister, three years older than I. "When I was a baby, just 4 years old, they took me away from my home and my daddy. We went to New York and mother accepted a theatrical engagement. Soon afterward I was given a part and ever since that time mother's work has consisted of drawing my salary. "I was treated like a child always. Told when to go to bed, when to get up, whom to meet and whom not to meet. The very people I was working with every day were not good enough for me to associate with. I must be gracious to this and to that person because they stood high socially and were wealthy. "The power of money was drilled into me on every hand. Mother said, 'be powerful even if you have to walk across the graves of others to get it.' She has no sympathy for the misfortune of another. 'The survival of the fittest,' was her watchword. "She is her own best press agent. She knows what to say to create sympathy for herself. My sister Margaret is a 'yes-girl.' It's 'yes mamma' this and 'yes mamma' that." All of which are but a few of the things which Miss Minter said as she announced her intention to take legal steps to secure an accounting for more than $1,000,000 which she asserts her mother has collected on motion picture contracts of the daughter. Formal notice of intention to bring suit has already been served, said both Miss Minter and her attorney. The trouble in Mary's home is said to have started shortly after she became of age a few months ago. At that time Mary is said to have decided to assume control of her own money and live alone "if she felt so inclined." Mrs. Shelby has always acted as the girl's guardian and objected to any change in the arrangements. Miss Minter declares that she is capable of taking care of herself and of her own money.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 10, 1923 LOS ANGELES HERALD "Mother never has refused a settlement with Mary," said Margaret. "To begin with, money was never discussed in our home. We had the happiest home imaginable. My mother has done what she thought was best for Mary and myself. It is bewildering to us why Mary has taken this stand. "It is unfortunate that Mary should make these charges just now when mother is so ill. We both love her dearly and no matter what Mary says, it will not change our attitude towards her. She can come home at any time and be received with open arms." But Mary Miles Minter smiled knowingly when told of her mother's plea for a reconciliation from her bed of pain. "My mother is not in danger of death," was her simple declaration. "It is only a ruse to get me to call off a lawsuit contemplated for the accounting of the salary I have earned. "Yes, I know, mother and Margaret say they love me better than anything else in life, that I am the very life and breath of their existence. "They should have said 'I have been' all of that. I was, for where would either of them be without the money I have made? "I do not have any affection for my mother. Let the world condemn, if it will. Even a worm will turn in time--and I have turned. Not because she is my mother. I want to love her, but she has driven me from her so far that there is no turning back. "How can my mother expect me to love and obey her when I have seen the way she has treated her own mother for years--as a glorified servant girl at my mother's beck and call. "Oh, yes I know mother and Margaret swear undying devotion to me. They should. I have been their meal ticket for years. If only they had made these protestations of love years ago, how different our lives might have been. "It isn't so very long ago since I tried to cuddle up to mother. To kiss and fondle her. What did I get? Told to 'Don't be silly' or 'Don't make a nuisance of yourself,' in private, but patted for the benefit of the world at large in public. It made a good impression, you know. "Perhaps love means more to me than it does to some young women my own age. I am 21, you know."

"I was given to understand that I could live there but could have no motion picture people or writers call upon me. Also that I had to put my lights out at 10 o'clock and could have no music in the evening. "I protested and told mother I could not live under those conditions and she said, 'Very well, then you won't live in my house until you do.' "Now you know some of the things that have made me dislike my mother. You can't go on sowing the wind without reaping the whirlwind. That's what mother is getting from me. She taught me, bit by bit, to distrust her. I can't help it. I just can't!" "Would you go back if your mother settled everything amicably with you in regard to freedom of conduct and money matters?" Miss Minter was asked. "Go back?" The wide blue eyes flashed resentfully. "Not if I had to scrub floors first. I'm through. I'm going to live my own life."

"In the patio are the things she loves--the birds in their swinging cages, the gold fish in the fountain, flowers everywhere--her tiny 'poms' waiting for her call. [4] "Mary wants her freedom to do as she wills. I have lived to protect her from that freedom until her mind is disciplined; until she is able to make wise decisions in the important things of life. I have wanted to see her philosophy of life based on fundamentals that make for happiness and content, and when she has acquired these, then will she be entitled to the fortune she has earned."

"For more than a year and a half I have kept secret that which was the sweetest and holiest thing in my life--my love for William Taylor," she said. "I loved Mr. Taylor the first moment I saw him. And today, nearly two years after his death, my love for him is stronger than ever. "I knew but little of Mr. Taylor's past life, but I knew that he was an honorable gentleman in all the word implies. He was a man's man, yet withal a man of gentleness and kindliness. He was cultured, but yet not immune to the human feelings of mankind. "I cared not who or what he was, for when he put his arms around me and said, 'Mary, I love you,' I knew that he was the one man in the whole world for me. And when I think that if it had not been for the continual bitter opposition to our engagement I would have been his wife it is almost more than I can bear. No wonder I am bitter. "My whole life was wrapped up in him. When I would come home from the studio I would dream of the home in which William Taylor and I would spend the balance of our lives. "But, no, he was too old, I was told. He was not an old man. William-- possibly you think it strange that I called him William or Mr. Taylor, but I so worshipped him that I could not think of calling him Bill--used to tell me that he would not allow me to sacrifice myself on a man his age. " 'I wonder if I am doing the right thing?' he would often ask me. 'You have brought me the greatest happiness of my life, but you have come at the time of the Setting Sun, while you are in the glory of youth.' "But I would not have it so. I knew that the years I spent with him, no matter how short, would be the happiest of my life, and we often discussed the little home we were going to build up in the Hollywood Hills. "Then came his death. It was like a bolt from a clear sky. I was simply stunned. With my soul starved for love by the life I had led at home, his tenderness and kindness seemed doubly sweet. "It was at this time that all the pressure possible was brought to bear by those under whose influence I was at the time to see that my engagement with Mr. Taylor was kept secret. "I mustn't talk; it would hurt my career; it was the same old story of hushing and shushing. The public must never know that I was engaged. I must be a little girl with golden curls. It would never do for the world to know that I was a human being instead of a doll-faced automaton."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 14, 1923 LOS ANGELES HERALD Love Diary of Mary Minter is Bared The silent leaves of Mary Miles Minter's love diary spoke today and told for the first time their heart-throbbing story of a tragic romance which has extended beyond the grave. With the passion and pathos of a literary classic they voiced of the thrill and thraldom of the deep and enduring affection of the beautiful young motion picture star for a man more than twice her age. The diary is bound in scarlet moire silk, as scarlet as the life-blood of William Desmond Taylor that stained the floor of his home on that memorable night he met death at the hands of an assassin, and in it Mary Miles Minter has recorded the yearnings and longings for her lost love. The first entry in the book was made two weeks after the death of Taylor. "Oh, my beloved, where are you?" the heartbroken girl wrote. Then she described her longing for the man whose arms would no longer embrace her. "You were to have been mine. Had I known you were to have been taken from me no power on earth could have kept us apart." It was night. In the distance music was playing. She recorded memories of happier times when music, which Taylor loved, had been a part of their lives. She told of her hours of anguish and bitter weeping for the man who was gone. "Where? I do not know, my beloved. But you are near, somewhere, of that I am certain. You could not leave me so utterly hopeless, alone and forlorn." Nine days later she again makes an entry of her grief and loss in the little book. This time "Chummy," the dog Taylor gave her, was stolen. "They have even taken away what you have given me," she wrote. "How a dog can understand! Better than most humans." Then in Honolulu, in June. Again the dancing throng of that playground of the Pacific recalled happier days with the man she had loved and lost. But she believed Taylor was not far away. She felt his presence and the little diary carried a message not of a hopeless death, but to one who had "gone away for a little time and would return again. "It is night again, dearest, our time of peace and surcease from the stress of life that grows so weary at times. Morning will come all too soon: and with its coming will begin again the weary tasks of life. Life without you, dearest, is weary. Our love was like a great white star that burns its way across the heavens. They are dancing down below. I can see them from the window. The lovely gowns look like bright colored balloons against the dark background. "Oh, Desmond, my love, where are you? Surely not so far away but that I will find you somehow, somewhere?" It was June again, in California. A year has rolled by since the last entry in the little diary. But the heart-hungry girl is still seeking her lost one. She is a woman now and realizes more fully her loss. "How long, my love, how long until you clasp me again in your dear arms?" That is the love of Mary Miles Minter for William Desmond Taylor, who rests under the golden sunshine in "God's Acre," where sleep the dead of this and other generations.

For months and months I have been hoping and praying that my differences with my mother might not bring up again the dreadful incidents of the murder of William Desmond Taylor. I have tried and tried to make no references to it in my statements concerning my effort to secure an accounting from my mother, but newspaper reporter after newspaper reporter has hounded me day and night always with questions, questions, questions about Mr. Taylor. The Times is the only newspaper which has not done this and because of this fact I am now giving the first statement that I have ever given under my own name. William Desmond Taylor came into my life when I was 17 years of age. He was the first man ever to call me Miss Minter. "How do you do, Miss Minter?" he said to me when first we were introduced, and then he smiled. Always before I had been called Mary and treated like a child by men and women alike, but Mr. Taylor called me "Miss Minter," which at that age, heart hungry as I was, made an instant impression. From that moment he fascinated me. I loved him the first time I saw him. "This is God," my heart sang when I looked into his face. I know the world will think that a very immature age and a very foolish conclusion for one so young. But you must remember that while for the last three years of my life my mother has tried to keep me a "little girl" with curls down my back, she earlier had made me appear and act older than I was. When I was 8 years old I was passed off for 16, twice my age, and dressed as a midget, with high heels and long skirts, so that I could play the stellar role of "The Littlest Rebel" at the Chicago Opera House. That was because the state law of Illinois prohibited children under 16 years of age from appearing as professional performers. These things have an effect upon a child that all the training and coaching in the world cannot eliminate. When I went into the movies it was different. Then mother wished to undue all the training of maturity she had imposed upon me and have me appear unsophisticated and simple, childlike and trustful. It was paradoxical. But I matured very quickly in this glorious sunshine and gorgeous setting of California. With the passing of the adolescent period, it became very evident to mother that men were attracted to me. I liked the company of men. They were jolly, good companions, splendid comrades and were not forever saying, "Don't do this," or "Don't do that." It worried mother because I was popular with them. The few with whom I came in contact were not attracted to Margaret. This was a bitter pill to both her and mother. Margaret is older than I and mother thought she should be given preference. But if a girl does not naturally attract men, all her efforts will fail. That was the status of things when I first met William Desmond Taylor. I knew when I laid eyes on him that he was the one man in the world for me, and that he reciprocated my love. It was not long afterward that we were in New England making a picture. My mother, my grandmother and sister were with the company. I used to listen for his footsteps as he came into the door of the little hotel where we stayed. I recognized them as they went up the stairway and into his room, which was just over the little parlor where we all sat. One time we all went into Boston for a dinner party for me. He rode in the automobile between my grandmother and me. The road was rough and bumpy, his arms were spread across the rear of the back seat in which we rode. One bump threw grandmother against him and he said, "I guess I will have to hold you." But his arm did not embrace me. "Dare I? Dare I?" I said to myself. I dared and I reached up and tugged at his coat sleeve and he dropped his arm about my waist. And coming home he did the same thing again. The thrill of that innocent act thrilled me for days and days. We spent what little time we could together, which was not much because mother always watched and every night after I had gone to bed she used to sit in the little parlor with him just as much as he would let her while he was working on his script. One day it rained dreadfully. We were out somewhere and he wrapped his coat about me and took me to the hotel. There stood mother, fairly raging. She accused Mr. Taylor before the entire company of taking me out, humiliating him most shamefully. For two days I hardly spoke to him and then I apologized for mother's action. "Your mother is right, Mary," he said. "She is right and you must always obey her." That was the beginning of quarrels between mother and I. He soon left and came to California. Grandmother and I came later, while mother and sister remained in the East. Sister Margaret had a sort of beaked nose and she had it operated on to straighten it out. That kept them in the East. We had a glorious reunion when we came west. Grandmother and I went riding with him, to dinner, to the theater. Then mother came. He used to call at our house. But soon mother noticed his preference for me. She put a stop to it. Until she knew of my love for Mr. Taylor, she had only words of praise for him. Then, suddenly, she turned against him. I told Mr. Taylor of her attitude. "Your mother knows best, Mary. I am an old man," he would say. Then I would kiss the words away. I did not know Mr. Taylor's age, but he was not old in spirit or understanding and that was all that mattered to me. He was mine. I wanted him, to be his wife, to be able to do the thousand and one little things for him that only a wife can do. I would have married him then and there, but he said we must wait. "Wait a while, Mary dear," he would caution. "Ah, do not think I don't want you, child. It is not that. But because of my great love for you I would shield you from the unkindness of the world. And the world would never forgive me for blighting your career. We must wait." But I did not want to wait. Perhaps many women would be ashamed to admit what I have admitted. But I am not ashamed. Our love was a glorious thing. "Why should we wait?" I would protest. As long as we had each other what else counted? Then I wrote letters, passionate, impulsive letters. Some of them were published. Many of those letters were written two years before he died. And he kept them. That was my one thought at the time. He kept them. Surely he must have loved me deeply, sincerely, to have kept them for so long. I did everything I could to make him break his resolve and marry at once. Not to wait until I was older. I loved him, oh, so sincerely and he loved me. He told me so many, many times. We were never engaged in the sense that he had asked me to marry him and I had promised. I had always hoped that sometime we would be married. But I had planned in my own mind--never with Mr. Taylor--that as soon as I had made enough money so that mother and sister could be assured of a comfortable income for the rest of their lives--that perhaps we would be married. But not engaged in the sense of wearing a ring, or of telling one's friends of an intention to marry or of telling my mother. Marrying Mr. Taylor was just my dream--a dream which, voiced to film, always met with the answer that it was impossible. Then mother took me to Europe. She told me of the lovely things we would buy over there. Things that were to be for my home, she said. Where are they today? Mother has them, if you please, and tells me they are not mine but hers. Mr. Taylor went to Europe, too. But I did not get to see him. Mother saw to that. I pleaded with her to let me see him but she always insisted that she would not permit me to throw myself at Mr. Taylor's head. So we tramped all over Europe, always careful to keep a safe distance between me and the man I loved. Eventually we came home. Mother and Margaret stopped over in Chicago and I came on west, home. I sent Mr. Taylor a message and he met me with flowers and a lovelight in his eyes that told me his affection for me had not diminished during my absence. I had a few days of delightful comradeship with him before mother returned, for my grandmother understood our great love and did not offer any interference. But when mother came home again Mr. Taylor was forbidden the house. Whenever I could I would slip away with Mr. Taylor, but the times seemed so far apart. All too seldom. Finally he told me I must not write him any more and must not call him up, that he would telephone to me. I waited a week, two weeks, three weeks and he did not call. I swallowed my humiliation and called him. His butler answered and told me he was ill. He was too ill to talk with me. I gave the butler instructions of what to make him eat, to see that he was well covered during the night. For five days he did not eat a thing and during it all I suffered more than I can express. Early in December before he was shot I had telephoned him and told him that I must see him. We had not talked with each other for weeks. We would pass on the lot and he would smile so sweetly, but in his eyes was the love- light that none but I could see. He made an appointment for me to come to his house in two weeks. Grandmother and I went. The house was dark. I was heartbroken. In the keyhole I twisted one of the little golden hairpins that I wear so that he would know I was there. No word from him, no telephone call. On December 23 I was downtown buying some Christmas presents--one for him that I never got to give him. I have it still. There in the store opposite me in another aisle he stood. He smiled so sweetly, bowed and was gone. The clerk came and brought some samples of something and I told her to wrap it up. I don't even know what it was, I was so dazed. My maid grasped me by the arm thinking I was going to faint. He went away. A few nights afterward I could not sleep. Everyone had gone to bed. I tiptoed to my grandmother's room and told her I must go to him. She tried to dissuade me, offered to go with me, but I told her no, that this was something I must do alone. I gathered up his pictures and a little golden mesh bag he had given me and stopped to write him a note. It said: "Dear William Desmond Taylor: This is good-by. I want you to know that I will always love you. Mary." I got out my car myself and went to his house. There was a light shining behind the blind. I rang the bell. All was silence. My heart stopped. I was afraid that perhaps he had gone out and that he had left the lights burning. But then I heard the rattle of a newspaper, the door opened and there he stood. "Why, Mary," he said. "It's quite late, isn't it?" "Yes, it is, nearly 12 o'clock," I answered. "But I must see you," and I pushed past him into the room. I noticed things were changed. That the furniture was moved, but on the wall there still hung my pictures, two of them and one of Mabel Normand. "Mary you should not have come here," he said. He was trembling, seemed to grow old standing before me. Perspiration covered his brow. "Here, read it. It's good-by," I said, handing him the note I had written. He read it and without a word turned to his desk, fumbled about and then handed me a note. "I thought you had gotten this two weeks ago," he said. I started to open it. "No, no," he cried. "Not here." "But I must," I said. "I must. Maybe there is something in it I must answer." "No, I beg of you, I entreat you. I cannot stand it if you do. Don't!" "Then tell me that you love me," I said. "I love you Mary, better than anything in this world, more than God," he answered. He led me to my car, helped me in. I reached out and squeezed his hand. In the house he had clenched his teeth, his face was drawn; his fingernails had been gripped so hard that he brought blood when the nails cut the skin. He had used a silk handkerchief he had tucked in his upper coat pocket to wipe away the blood. As we stood by the car door I pulled this handkerchief from his pocket and took it, handing him mine. He kissed it and slowly walked back into the house. I drove home. That was the last time I ever saw him alone. After that a few times I met him on the lot. Again he smiled and spoke, but that was all. In February one morning I was dressing. It was about 11 o'clock. I was standing in my undergarments before the mirror fixing my hair. I heard my mother's footsteps coming, pat, pat, pat down the hall. I knew something was wrong from the way she was walking. She pounded on the door. "Let me in," she said. "But I am not dressed," I protested. I had on nothing but a chemise, and mother always scolded me if I appeared before her even in a negligee. "Let me in," she fairly shouted. "Let me in or I shall break down the door." All this time she was pounding. I told her she must wait until I got into a dress and then I opened the door. "What do you think has happened?" she said. I looked at her, for she seemed greatly excited. "William Desmond Taylor has just been found murdered in his bed." She added some more words which were not altogether complimentary to Mr. Taylor. "Where were you last night?" "I was here, of course," I said, hardly realizing what she was saying. I was dumbfounded. Mother talked on in a most excited manner. I can't remember what she said--all of it--but it was something about this would teach me a lesson and how to behave myself in the future. Then mother said, "Well, why don't you say something?" I couldn't. I was too hurt. I grabbed a hat, a wrap and then began to look through my pocket book, through the drawers of the dresser. I was hunting for the keys to my car. I thought I would go frantic in the few moments that it took. "Where are you going?" mother asked. "To him, of course," I replied. "You cannot, you cannot. I shall not let you," she said and stood before the door to stop me. "You'll not leave this room. I'm going to lock you in and here you'll stay until I say you can come out." I pleaded with her. "You've kept me from the man I love in life and you can't keep me from him in death. I'll scream and raise the neighborhood. I am going to him if I have to throttle you to get past," I cried. And she stepped aside. I drove to his home in a daze. Newspaper reporters, officers and other people were before the house. They were carrying out books and papers. "Who are you and what are you doing here?" they asked me. "I am Mary Miles Minter and I have come to see Mr. Taylor," I answered. "But he is not here. They have taken him to the undertakers," they said. I got in my car and drove downtown to the undertakers. I drove and drove, round and round that block until finally I found the place. I went in. I asked to see him and they told me I could not, that they were trying to find the bullet. "I must see him. I must see him," I told the man. "You cannot see him until after the inquest," I was told. "It is against the law for me to let you see him before." Finally he promised me that I could see him the next day at noon and I went away. Then I drove to Mabel Normand's home. I was frantic. Without ringing the bell I went in. There were reporters in the parlor waiting for her. I rushed upstairs. She was dressing. I grasped her by the shoulders, shook her and looked straight into her eyes. "What do you know about it?" I asked. "Nothing," she answered simply. "Not a thing but what they have told me." And I believed her and still believe her. The next day I went to the undertakers and they let me in all alone with him. I pulled back the sheet and looked at him. But he was not the same. His skin was waxen. I leaned down and put my arms about him, my cheek next to his. His face was cold, so cold, but not a cold like ice. "Do you love me, Desmond?" I said. He answered me. I could hear his voice. "I love you, Mary; I shall love you always," he whispered. I kissed him and put a red rose in his hand from some I had brought with me. The door opened. The undertaker was there. I went away. Mother and the attorney did the talking for me. They told of my childlike affection for an old man. How I trusted and loved him as a father. But I tell you here and now it was no childlike affection. It was a full grown woman's love for her mate. For William Desmond Taylor is the one great love of my life and always will be.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 15, 1923 LOS ANGELES HERALD How old is Mary Miles Minter? Is she 30 years of age, as her father says she is? Is she 21 years of age, as her mother says she is? Or is the age of the beautiful motion picture star as much of a mystery to others as it is to herself and as she recorded in her diary, along with her heart secrets of her great passion for William Desmond Taylor when she wrote, "Nobody knows my real age." The little book, whose mute revelations of the great love Mary Miles Minter bore her ill-fated fiance, has spoke again. "Nobody knows my real age," Miss Minter wrote. "Even Jeanie McPherson, my closest friend, does not know that. They tell me I am a child. Perhaps I am. Yet I feel tonight, since you went away,"--referring to Taylor's death-- that I am 50." In news dispatches from Dallas, Tex., where he is employed on a newspaper as a proof reader, Homer Riley, who declares he is the father of Mary Miles Minter, emphatically states that Mary Miles Minter is 30 years of age. The mystery of Miss Minter's age also may throw some light upon the recent avowal of the girl that Mrs. Shelby was not acting in purely a motherly role in attempting to disrupt the romance between Miss Minter and William Desmond Taylor, slain film director. At the time of Taylor's murder Mrs. Shelby declared against the protest of Miss Minter that her daughter loved Taylor in a fatherly fashion. "She knows better than that," Miss Minter vehemently declared. "Mother knew just how I loved Mr. Taylor. There was no fatherly love in our relationship." Miss Minter then declared that her mother had endeavored to play the role of rival for the love of Taylor.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 15, 1923 LOS ANGELES RECORD Mother Loved Taylor, Says Mary Minter "Mother liked William Desmond Taylor very much. In fact she tried to interest him in herself. She sought to put me in the background and her interference in my romance was not because she wished to protect me but because she considered me a rival." This new revelation of Mary Miles Minter, casts a different reflection of the movie star's relations with her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby and leads friends of the girl to believe that perhaps love and rivalry and not finances after all is behind the quarrel between them. "Mother thought that he was more her age than mine and she sought in every way to win his favor. It was not until she discovered that he cared more for me did she cease extending him the warmth of her friendship. "When Mr. Taylor realized my mother's attitude--that she tried to keep me from him through jealousy--he, in his kind, considerate way, told me I was a little girl and that I should consider my mother. 'You know I love you more than anything in life but you must do nothing to displease her,' he told me." A report from the Shelby home today indicated that Mrs. Shelby is willing to make any settlement with Mary providing the girl gives no more interviews regarding the Taylor affair.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 16, 1923 LOS ANGELES TIMES Mary Miles Minter is Gone Mary Miles Minter may perhaps not be missing, but she certainly is absent--A.W.O.L. may be the better way of putting it. Mary's friends searched for her in vain yesterday. At her Pasadena bungalow it was reported that she did not come home Tuesday night and had not been there during yesterday. At the home of Mary's mother, the home on South New Hampshire Street which Mary says is really hers, and not Mrs. Charlotte Shelby's, a maid volunteered the information that Mrs. Shelby was very weak and could not be seen. Her daughter, Margaret, is the constant companion of her mother. Miss Margaret is declared to have laughed outright when she read an evening newspaper stating that in reality Mary is more than 30 years of age. Margaret, who has always admittedly been an older sister, said it was really a good joke--i.e., the item of Mary's age.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 16, 1923 LOS ANGELES EXPRESS Everybody appeared to be sick of the whole thing. No one was to be seen. Sister Margaret was out--for the day. Mrs. Shelby too ill to be seen. Mary Miles Minter has disappeared, seemingly into thin air. Evidently the generals in both camps needed a breathing spell, or did it mean retreat? The Shelby-Minter duet was evidently to be given the soft pedal. In one short week, they had run the gamut, with Mary's high angry trills, and mother's low dignified alto. With Mary's doll story thrown into the ring for comedy, and the William Desmond Taylor case dug up to supply the tragedy. The play seemed over, and the audience ready for a new farce or tragedy.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 15, 1923 LOS ANGELES HERALD Documents Located in South Mary Miles Minter was 21 years old April 25, last. The statements attributed to her father that she was 30 years old were officially exploded today in dispatches received from Shreveport, La., where the official records showed that she was born April 25, 1902, and christened Juliet Riley.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * August 17, 1923 LOS ANGELES TIMES Miss Minter is Found After spending what she characterized at "the two happiest days of my life, because I did not see a single reporter," Mary Miles Minter was found by a reporter for the Times late last night. But Miss Minter made up for time lost away from reporters by declaring she has not "disappeared," but is only seeking seclusion, that she is "still keeping advised as to mother's health," that she has not signed any theatrical contracts as yet; and that she will be very grateful if anyone can prove to her that she is 30 years old, as reported. Miss Minter's statement is as follows: "If the Los Angeles Times or anyone else in this world can prove that I am 30 years old, I will be deeply grateful to them. I supposed I was only 21 years old. If I am really 30, I will be able to collect from my mother a much larger sum than I hoped to get. "The money I am seeking an accounting for comprises my earnings under my Lasky contract for the past three years, or, in other words, since I have been of legal age in California. The three years is on the basis that I am 21 years old. My mother has always told me that the legal age is 21 years, therefore, I had supposed I was a minor until my twenty-first birthday. As a matter of fact, however, legally I have been my own boss for three years and did not know it. "I have made considerable sums of money in pictures in the years prior to my eighteenth birthday. Therefore, if I were now 30 I could have more years of earnings for which I could seek an accounting from my mother." In the meantime Mrs. Shelby is reported as still too ill to be interviewed. Miss Margaret, upon orders of the family attorney, has nothing further to say. Word was also received from Dallas that the correct age of Miss Minter is 21 years. J. H. Reilly, her father confirmed that Miss Minter was born in Shreveport, La., in 1902. He also denied that he had made any statements to the effect that Miss Minter was 30 years of age.
